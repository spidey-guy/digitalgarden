A seizure can be dened as the occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal, excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. The lifetime risk of an isolated seizure is about 5%, although incidence is highest at the extremes of age. Epilepsy is the tendency to have unprovoked seizures. While the prevalence of active epilepsy in European countries is about 0.5%, this gure varies globally and can be inuenced by the prevalence of parasitic illnesses such as cysticercosis. A recent change in denition allows the diagnosis of epilepsy to be made after a single seizure with a high risk of recurrence (e.g. a single seizure in the presence of a cortical lesion). Such changes may lead to an observed increase in epilepsy incidence. Historical terms such as ‘grand mal’ (implying tonic–clonic seizures)
and ‘petit mal’ (intended originally to mean ‘absence seizures’ but commonly misused to describe ‘anything other than grand mal’) have been superseded. Subsequent revisions, including terms such as ‘complex partial’ and ‘simple partial’, have been imprecise and carry little information about underlying pathology, treatment or prognosis. The modern equivalents for these terms will be given below, but it is preferable to adhere to the 2017 iteration of the International League Against Epilepsy's classication (Box 28.26).

# Pathophysiology
To function normally, the brain must maintain a continual balance between excitation and inhibition, remaining responsive to the environment while avoiding continued unrestrained spontaneous activity. The inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is particularly important, acting on ion channels to enhance chloride inow and reducing the chances of action potential formation. Excitatory amino acids (glutamate and aspartate) allow inux of sodium and calcium, producing the opposite effect. It is likely that many seizures result from an imbalance between this excitation and inhibition. Intracellular recordings during seizures demonstrate a paroxysmal depolarisation shift in neuronal membrane potential, an upshift in internal potential predisposing to recurrent action potentials. In vivo, epileptic cortex shows repetitive discharges involving large groups of neurons.

## Focal epilepsy 
Seizures may be related to a localised disturbance in the cortex, becoming manifest in the rst instance as focal seizures. Any disturbance of cortical architecture and function can precipitate this, whether focal infection, tumour, hamartoma or trauma-related scarring. If focal seizures remain localised, the symptoms experienced depend on which cortical area is affected. If areas in the temporal lobes become involved, then awareness of the environment becomes impaired but without associated tonic–clonic movements. When both hemispheres become involved, the seizure becomes generalised (Fig. 28.23).

[[0 Neurology/Davidson/Attachments/Davidson Neurology 15.webp|Fig. 28.23 The pathophysiological classication of seizures.]]

## Generalised epilepsies 
The new terminology is genetic generalised epilepsies (GGEs) (previously idiopathic generalised epilepsies, and many prefer to still use this term) to reect their likely cause. These seizures are generalised at onset, abnormal activity probably originating in the central mechanisms controlling cortical activation (see Fig. 28.23) and spreading rapidly. This group constitutes around 30% of all epilepsy and is likely to reect widespread disturbance of structure or function. GGEs almost always become apparent before the age of 35. Seizure activity is usually apparent on EEG as spike and wave discharges (see Fig. 28.14). Other generalised seizures may involve merely brief loss of awareness (absence seizures), single jerks (myoclonus) or loss of tone (atonic seizures), as detailed in Box 28.26

# Clinical features
## Seizure type and epilepsy type 
Patients can experience more than one type of seizure attack, and it is important to document each attack type and the patient's age at its onset, along with its frequency, duration and typical features. Any triggers should be identied (Box 28.27). The type of seizure, other clinical features and investigations can then be used to determine the epilepsy syndrome, as discussed below. Where there is doubt about the type, this is best stated and a full classication should be deferred until the evolution of the clinical features claries the picture. To classify seizure type, the clinician should ask rstly whether there
is a focal onset, and secondly whether the seizures conform to one of the recognised patterns (see Box 28.26). Epilepsy that starts in patients beyond their mid-thirties will almost invariably reect a focal cerebral event. Where activity remains focal, the classication will be obvious. With generalised tonic–clonic seizures, a focal onset will be heralded by positive neurological symptoms and signs corresponding to the normal function of that area. Occipital onset causes visual changes (lights and blobs of colour), temporal lobe onset causes false recognition (déjà vu), sensory strip involvement causes sensory alteration (burning, tingling) and motor strip involvement causes jerking. Alternatively, patients report a previous local cortical insult, and it
may be reasonably (but not invariably) inferred that this is the seat of epileptogenesis.

### Focal seizures
The classication of focal seizures is shown in Box 28.26. They are caused by localised cortical activity. The localisation of such symptoms is described above. A spreading pattern of seizure may occur, the abnormal sensation spreading much faster (in seconds) than a migrainous focal sensory attack. Awareness may become impaired if spread occurs to the temporal lobes (previously ‘complex partial seizure’). Patients stop and stare blankly, often blinking repetitively, making smacking movements of their lips or displaying other automatisms, such as picking at their clothes. After a few minutes consciousness returns but the patient may be muddled and feel drowsy for a period of up to an hour. The age of onset, preceding aura, longer duration and post-ictal symptoms usually make these easy to differentiate from childhood absence seizures (see below). Seizures arising from the anterior parts of the frontal lobe may produce bizarre behaviour patterns, including limb posturing, sleep walking or even frenetic, ill-directed motor activity with incoherent screaming. Video EEG may be necessary to differentiate these from psychogenic attacks (which are more common) but abruptness of onset, stereotyped nature, relative brevity and nocturnal preponderance may indicate a frontal origin. Causes of focal seizures are given in Box 28.28

### Generalised seizures
#### Tonic–clonic seizures 
An initial ‘aura’ may be experienced by the patient, depending on the cortical area from which the seizure originates (as above). The patient then becomes rigid (tonic) and unconscious, falling heavily if standing (‘like a log’) and risking facial injury. During this phase, breathing stops and central cyanosis may occur. As cortical discharges reduce in frequency, jerking (clonic) movements emerge for 2 minutes at most. Afterwards, there is a accid state of deep coma, which can persist for some minutes, and on regaining awareness the patient may be confused, disorientated and/or amnesic. During the attack, urinary incontinence and tongue-biting may occur. A severely bitten, bleeding tongue after an attack of loss of consciousness is pathognomonic of a generalised seizure but less marked lingual injury can occur in syncope. Subsequently, the patient usually feels unwell and sleepy, with headache and myalgia. Witnesses are usually frightened by the event, often believe the person to be dying, and may struggle to give a clear account of the episode. Some may not describe the tonic or clonic phase and may not mention cyanosis or tongue-biting. In less typical episodes, post-ictal delirium, or sequelae such as headache or myalgia, may be the main pointers to the diagnosis. Causes of generalised tonic–clonic seizures are listed in Box 28.29

#### Absence seizures 
Absence seizures (previously ‘petit mal’) always start in childhood. The attacks are rarely mistaken for focal seizures because of their brevity. They can occur so frequently (20–30 times a day) that they are mistaken for daydreaming or poor concentration in school.

#### Myoclonic seizures 
These are typically brief, jerking movements, predominating in the arms. In epilepsy, they are more marked in the morning or on awakening from sleep, and tend to be provoked by fatigue, alcohol, or sleep deprivation.

#### Atonic seizures 
These are seizures involving brief loss of muscle tone, usually resulting in heavy falls with or without loss of consciousness. They occur only in the context of epilepsy syndromes that involve other forms of seizure.

#### Tonic seizures 
These are associated with a generalised increase in tone and an associated loss of awareness. They are usually seen as part of an epilepsy syndrome and are unlikely to be isolated.

#### Clonic seizures 
Clonic seizures are similar to tonic–clonic seizures. The clinical manifestations are similar but there is no preceding tonic phase.

### Seizures of uncertain generalised or focal nature

#### Epileptic spasms 
While these are highlighted in the classication system, they are unusual in adult practice and occur mainly in infancy. They signify widespread cortical disturbance and take the form of marked contractions of the axial musculature, lasting a fraction of a second but recurring in clusters of 5–50, often on awakening.
# Epilepsy syndromes
Many patients with epilepsy fall into specic patterns, depending on seizure type(s), age of onset and treatment responsiveness: the so-called electroclinical syndromes (Box 28.30). It is anticipated that genetic testing will ultimately demonstrate similarities in molecular pathophysiology.
Box 28.31 highlights the more common epilepsy syndromes, which
are largely of early onset and are sensitive to sleep deprivation, hyperventilation, alcohol and photic stimulation. Epilepsies that do not t into any of these diagnostic categories can be delineated rstly on the basis of the presence or absence of a known structural or metabolic condition (presumed cause), and then on the basis of the primary mode of seizure onset (generalised versus focal).

# Investigations

## Single seizure 
All patients with transient loss of consciousness should have a 12-lead ECG. Where seizure is suspected or denite, patients should have cranial imaging with either MRI or CT, although the yield is low unless focal signs are present. EEG may help to assess prognosis once a rm diagnosis has been made. The recurrence rate after a rst seizure is approximately 40% and most recurrent attacks occur within a month or two of the rst. Further seizures are less likely if an identied trigger can be avoided (see Box 28.27). Other investigations for infective, toxic and metabolic causes
(Box 28.32) may be appropriate. An EEG performed immediately after a seizure may be more helpful in showing focal features than if performed after a delay.

## Epilepsy 
The same investigations are required in a patient with epilepsy (Box 28.32). The EEG may help to establish the type of epilepsy and guide therapy. Investigations should be revisited if the epilepsy is intractable to treatment. Inter-ictal EEG is abnormal in only about 50% of patients with recurrent
seizures, so it cannot be used to exclude epilepsy. The sensitivity can be increased to about 85% by prolonging recording time and including a period of natural or drug-induced sleep, but this does not replace a well-taken history. Ambulatory EEG recording or video EEG monitoring may help with differentiation of epilepsy from other disorders if attacks are sufciently frequent.
Indications for imaging are summarised in Box 28.33. Imaging cannot establish a diagnosis of epilepsy but identies any structural cause. It is not required if a condent diagnosis of a recognised GGE syndrome (e.g. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy) is made. While CT excludes a major structural cause of epilepsy, MRI is required to demonstrate subtle changes such as hippocampal sclerosis, which may direct or inform surgical intervention.

	 Seizures having focal features clinically

	 Control of seizures difcult or deteriorating
# Management
It is important to explain the nature and cause of seizures to patients and their relatives, and to instruct relatives in the rst aid management of seizures (Box 28.34). Many people with epilepsy feel stigmatised and may become unnecessarily isolated from work and social life. It is important to emphasise that epilepsy is a common disorder that affects 0.5%–1% of the population, and that full control of seizures can be expected in approximately 70% of patients (Box 28.35).

## 28.34 How to administer rst aid for seizures
**** Move the person away from danger (re, water, machinery, furniture) 
**** After convulsions cease, turn the person into the ‘recovery’ position (semi-prone)
**** Ensure the airway is clear but do NOT insert anything in the mouth (tonguebiting occurs at seizure onset and cannot be prevented by observers)
**** If convulsions continue for more than 5 mins or recur without the person regaining consciousness, summon urgent medical attention
**** Do not leave the person alone until fully recovered (drowsiness and delirium can persist for up to 1 hr)

## 28.35 Epilepsy: outcome after 20 years
**** 50% are seizure-free, without drugs, for the previous 5 years 
**** 20% are seizure-free for the previous 5 years but continue to take medication
**** 30% continue to have seizures in spite of antiepileptic therapy

## Immediate care 
Little can or needs to be done for a person during a convulsive seizure except for rst aid and common-sense manoeuvres to limit damage or secondary complications (see Box 28.34). Advice should be given that on no account should anything be inserted into the patient's mouth. The management of status epilepticus is described on page 1137.

## Lifestyle advice 
Patients should be advised to avoid activities where they might place themselves or others at risk if they have a seizure. This applies at work, at home and at leisure. At home, only shallow baths (or showers) should be taken. Prolonged cycle journeys should be discouraged until reasonable freedom from seizures has been achieved. Activities involving prolonged proximity to water (swimming, shing or boating) should always be carried out in the company of someone who is aware of the risks and the potential need for rescue measures. Driving regulations vary between countries and the patient should be made aware of these (Box 28.36). Certain occupations, such as reghter or airline pilot, are not open to those with a previous or active diagnosis of epilepsy; further information is available from epilepsy support organisations. The risk of harm from epilepsy should be discussed around the time
of diagnosis. In particular epilepsy is associated with a very small, but potentially modiable, risk of sudden death (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, SUDEP). Explaining risks of epilepsy, including SUDEP, should be done with care and sensitivity, and with the aim of motivating the patient to adapt habits and lifestyle to optimise epilepsy control and minimise risks of serious complications.

	 No licence permitted if any seizure has occurred after the age of 5 years until patient is off medication and seizure-free for more than 10 years, and has no potentially epileptogenic brain lesion

## Antiepileptic drugs
Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) should be considered where risk of seizure recurrence is high. A diagnosis of two or more seizures is justication enough but a prolonged inter-seizure interval may deter some patients and physicians. Treatment decisions should always be shared with the patient, to enhance adherence. A wide range of drugs is available. These agents either increase inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain or alter neuronal sodium channels to prevent abnormally rapid transmission of impulses. In the majority of patients, full control is achieved with a single drug. Dose regimens should be kept as simple as possible. Guidelines are listed in Box 28.37. For focal epilepsies, one large study suggests that lamotrigine is the best-tolerated monotherapy, which, alongside its favourable adverse-effect prole and relative lack of pharmacokinetic interactions, makes it a good rst-line drug, although caution must be exercised with oral contraceptive use. Unclassied or genetic generalised epilepsies respond best to valproate, although pregnancy-related problems mean that valproate should not be used in women of reproductive age unless the benets outweigh the risks. The initial choice should be an established rst-line drug (Box 28.38), with more recently introduced drugs as second choice.

### 28.37 Guidelines for antiepileptic drug therapy*
	 Start with one rst-line drug (see Box 28.38) 
	 Start at a low dose; gradually increase dose until effective control of seizures is achieved or side-effects develop
	 Optimise adherence (use minimum number of doses per day) 
	 If rst drug fails (seizures continue or side-effects develop), start second first-line drug, followed if possible by gradual withdrawal of rst
	 If second drug fails (seizures continue or side-effects develop), start second-line drug in combination with the preferred baseline drug at maximum tolerated dose (beware interactions)
	 If this combination fails (seizures continue or side-effects develop), replace second-line drug with alternative second-line drug
	 If this combination fails, check adherence and reconsider diagnosis. (Are events seizures? Occult lesion? Treatment adherence/alcohol/drugs confounding response?)
	 Consider alternative, non-drug treatments (e.g. epilepsy surgery, vagal nerve stimulation)
	 Use minimum number of drugs in combination at any one time

## Monitoring therapy 
Some practitioners confuse epilepsy care with serum level monitoring. The newer drugs have much more predictable pharmacokinetics than the older ones and the only indication for measuring serum levels is if there is doubt about adherence. Blood levels need to be interpreted carefully and dose changes made to treat the patient rather than to bring a serum level into the ‘therapeutic range’. Some centres advocate serum level monitoring during pregnancy (notably with lamotrigine) but the evidence of benet for this is not strong.

## Epilepsy surgery 
Some patients with drug-resistant epilepsy benet from surgical resection of epileptogenic brain tissue. Less invasive treatments, including vagal nerve stimulation or deep brain stimulation, may also be helpful in some patients. All those who continue to experience seizures despite appropriate drug treatment should be considered for surgical treatment. Planning such interventions requires intensive specialist assessment and investigation to identify the site of seizure onset and the dispensability of any target areas for resection, i.e. whether the area of brain involved is necessary for a critical function such as vision or motor function.

## Withdrawing antiepileptic therapy 
Withdrawal of medication may be considered after a patient has been seizure-free for more than 2 years. Childhood-onset epilepsy, particularly classical absence seizures, carries the best prognosis for successful drug withdrawal. Other epilepsy syndromes, such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, have a marked tendency to recur after drug withdrawal. Focal epilepsies that begin in adult life are also likely to recur, especially
if there is an identied structural lesion. Overall, the recurrence rate after drug withdrawal depends on the individual's epilepsy history. An individualised estimate may be gained from the SIGN guideline tables (see ‘Further information’). Patients should be advised of the risks of recurrence, to allow them to
decide whether or not they wish to withdraw. If undertaken, withdrawal should be done slowly, reducing the drug dose gradually over weeks or months. Withdrawal may necessitate precautions around driving or occupation (see Box 28.36).

## Contraception 
Some AEDs induce hepatic enzymes that metabolise synthetic hormones, increasing the risk of contraceptive failure. This is most marked with carbamazepine, phenytoin and barbiturates, but clinically signicant effects can be seen with lamotrigine and topiramate. If the AED cannot be changed, this can be overcome by giving higher-dose preparations of the oral contraceptive. Sodium valproate and levetiracetam have no interaction with hormonal contraception.

## Pregnancy and reproduction 
Epilepsy presents specic management problems during pregnancy (Box 28.39). There is usually concern about the risks of teratogenesis associated with AEDs which must be balanced against the benets of these drugs. It is important to recognise proportionate risks: background risk of severe fetal malformation in the general population is around 2%–3%, while the AED most associated with teratogenesis is sodium valproate, which, at high dose, increases the risk to up to 10%. Long-term observational studies show that most of the commonly used AEDs can be given safely in pregnancy, although the risk of congenital abnormalities in the fetus is dependent on the type, number and dose of AEDs. Over the past few years medicines regulatory agencies have strengthened their warnings surrounding the risk of birth defects and developmental disorders in children born to women who take valproate during pregnancy. In the UK it has been emphasised that if valproate is taken during pregnancy, up to 4 in 10 babies are at risk of developmental disorders, in addition to the 1 in 10 who are at risk of birth defects. Consequently, in the UK, valproate must no longer be used in any woman or girl able to have children, unless she has a pregnancy prevention programme in place. Pre-conception treatment with folic acid (5 mg daily), along with use
of the smallest effective doses of as few AEDs as possible, may reduce the risk of fetal abnormalities. The risks of abrupt AED withdrawal to the mother should be stressed. Seizures may become more frequent during pregnancy, particularly if pharmacokinetic changes decrease serum levels of AEDs (see Box 28.39). Menstrual irregularities and reduced fertility are more common in
women with epilepsy, and are also increased by sodium valproate. Patients with epilepsy are at greater risk of osteoporosis, apparently independently of the drug used. Some centres advocate vitamin D supplementation in any patient with epilepsy but the higher female risk of osteoporosis makes this most important in women. Oral contraception can interact with individual AEDs (see Box 28.39).

### 28.39 Epilepsy in pregnancy
** Provision of pre-conception counselling is best practice**: start folic acid (5 mg daily for 2 months) before conception to reduce the risk of fetal malformations.
** Fetal malformation**: risk is minimised if a single drug is used. Carbamazepine and lamotrigine have the lowest incidence of major fetal malformations.
The risk with sodium valproate is particularly high (see text) and should be carefully balanced against its benets.
Levetiracetam may be safe but avoid other newer drugs if possible.
** Learning difculties in children:** IQ may be lower when children are exposed to valproate in utero, so its use should always be considered carefully.
** Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn**: enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs increase risk. Give IM vitamin K (1 mg) to the infant at birth.
** Increased frequency of seizures:** where breakthrough seizures occur, monitor antiepileptic drug levels and adjust the dose regimen accordingly.
** Pharmacokinetic effects of pregnancy:** carbamazepine levels may fall in the third trimester. Lamotrigine and levetiracetam levels may fall early in pregnancy. Some advocate monitoring of levels.

# Prognosis
The outcome of newly diagnosed epilepsy is generally good. Overall, generalised epilepsies and generalised seizures are more readily controlled than focal seizures. The presence of a structural lesion reduces the chances of freedom from seizures. The overall prognosis for epilepsy is shown in Box 28.35. Problems that epilepsy poses in older adults and in adolescents are summarised in Boxes 28.40 and 28.41, respectively.

## 28.40 Epilepsy in old age
** Incidence and prevalence:** late-onset epilepsy is very common and the annual incidence in those over 60 years is rising.
** Fits and faints:** the features that usually differentiate these may be less denitive than in younger patients.
** Non-convulsive status epilepticus:** can present as delirium in old age. 
** Cerebrovascular disease:** the underlying cause of seizures in 30%–50% of patients over the age of 50 years. A seizure may occur with an overt stroke or with occult vascular disease.
** Neurogenerative disease or dementia:** should be considered when epilepsy presents in old age.
** Antiepileptic drug regimens:** keep as simple as possible and take care to avoid interactions with other drugs being prescribed.
** Carbamazepine-induced hyponatraemia:** increases signicantly with age; this is particularly important in patients on diuretics or those with heart failure.
** Withdrawal of antiepileptic therapy:** drug withdrawal should be attempted only where benets exceed risk of harm from seizures.

## 28.41 Epilepsy in adolescence
** Effect on school/education:** seizures, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and psychological complications of epilepsy may hamper education. Fear may make some educational institutions unduly restrictive.
** Effect on family relationships**: parents may adopt a protective role, which can lead to epilepsy (and AEDs) becoming a point of assertion and rebellion.
** Effect on career choice:** epilepsy may exclude or restrict employment in the emergency services and armed forces.
** Alcohol:** may affect sleep pattern; excess may be associated with poor AED adherence.
** Illicit drugs:** may affect seizure threshold and be associated with poor AED adherence.
** Sleep disturbance:** may be worsened by social activities and computer games. 
** Oral contraception:** interactions with AED can occur. Use may not always be disclosed to parents.

# Status epilepticus
Presentation and management are described on page 1137. While generalised status epilepticus is most easily recognised, non-convulsive status may be less dramatic and less easily diagnosed. It may cause only altered awareness, delirium or wandering with automatisms. In an intensive care unit setting, EEG monitoring is essential to ensure that diagnosis and treatment are optimised.

# Non-epileptic attack disorder (‘dissociative attacks’)
The difculty with nomenclature is discussed on page 1152. Patients may present with attacks that resemble epileptic seizures but are caused by psychological phenomena and have no abnormal EEG discharges. Such attacks may be very prolonged, sometimes mimicking status epilepticus. Epileptic and non-epileptic attacks may coexist and time and effort are needed to clarify the relative contribution of each, allowing more accurate and comprehensive treatment. Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) may be accompanied by dramatic ailing of the limbs and arching of the back, with side-to-side head movements and vocalising. Cyanosis and severe biting of the tongue are rare but incontinence can occur. Distress and crying are common following non-epileptic attacks. The distinction between epileptic attacks originating in the frontal lobes and non-epileptic attacks may be especially difcult, and may require videotelemetry with prolonged EEG recordings. Non-epileptic attacks are three times more common in women than in men. They are not necessarily associated with formal psychiatric illness. Patients and carers may need reassurance that hospital admission is not required for every attack. Prevention requires psychotherapeutic interventions rather than drug therapy.

# Summary
## GLM 4

The provided text, "activeNote," is a comprehensive overview of epilepsy, covering its definition, classification, pathophysiology, clinical features, investigations, management, and prognosis. Here's a summary of the key points:

**Definition and Classification:**

*   A seizure is defined as abnormal brain activity leading to signs or symptoms.
*   Epilepsy is the tendency to have unprovoked seizures.
*   The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) provides the current classification system for seizures, categorizing them based on onset (generalized, focal, unknown) and clinical features (motor, non-motor).

**Pathophysiology:**

*   Seizures result from an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain.
*   Abnormal electrical activity spreads, leading to various seizure types.

**Clinical Features:**

*   Seizures can vary in type, frequency, duration, and triggers.
*   Focal seizures originate in a specific brain area, while generalized seizures involve both hemispheres.
*   Common seizure types include tonic-clonic, absence, myoclonic, atonic, and tonic seizures.

**Investigations:**

*   A 12-lead ECG is essential for patients with transient loss of consciousness.
*   Cranial imaging (MRI or CT) helps identify structural causes of epilepsy.
*   EEG is used to assess seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, and guide treatment.

**Management:**

*   First aid for seizures involves ensuring safety and airway clearance.
*   Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are the primary treatment, with choices depending on seizure type and individual factors.
*   Epilepsy surgery may be considered for drug-resistant epilepsy.
*   Lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding triggers and managing stress, are important.

**Prognosis:**

*   The overall prognosis for epilepsy is good, with approximately 70% of patients achieving seizure control.
*   Generalized epilepsies tend to have a better prognosis than focal epilepsies.
*   The presence of a structural brain lesion can worsen the prognosis.

**Special Considerations:**

*   Epilepsy in older adults is often associated with cerebrovascular disease or neurodegenerative disorders.
*   Adolescents with epilepsy may face challenges related to education, family relationships, career choices, and substance use.
*   Status epilepticus is a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment.
*   Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) is a condition where seizures are caused by psychological factors rather than abnormal brain activity.

This summary provides a concise overview of the key aspects of epilepsy covered in the "activeNote" text. It highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and ongoing management to improve the quality of life for individuals with epilepsy.

**Summary of Epilepsy**

**Definition & Epidemiology**  
- **Seizure**: Abnormal, excessive neuronal activity in the brain, with a 5% lifetime risk.  
- **Epilepsy**: Tendency for unprovoked seizures; prevalence ~0.5% globally. Updated criteria allow diagnosis after a single seizure with high recurrence risk (e.g., cortical lesion).  

**Classification (ILAE 2017)**  
- **Focal Onset**: Arises from localized cortex; subtypes include motor (e.g., tonic-clonic, automatisms) and non-motor (e.g., sensory, cognitive).  
- **Generalized Onset**: Involves both hemispheres; subtypes include motor (e.g., tonic-clonic, myoclonic) and non-motor (e.g., absence seizures).  
- **Unknown Onset**: Seizures without clear origin.  

**Pathophysiology**  
- Imbalance between excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmission.  
- **Focal epilepsy**: Linked to cortical disturbances (e.g., tumors, trauma).  
- **Generalized epilepsy**: Often genetic (formerly "idiopathic"), with widespread neuronal dysfunction.  

**Clinical Features**  
- **Focal seizures**: Symptoms depend on affected cortex (e.g., déjà vu in temporal lobe). May progress to generalized seizures.  
- **Generalized seizures**: Include tonic-clonic (loss of consciousness, rigidity/jerking), absence (brief lapses in awareness), and myoclonic (sudden jerks).  
- **Triggers**: Sleep deprivation, alcohol, flashing lights, metabolic disturbances.  

**Investigations**  
- **EEG**: Identifies seizure type but may be normal interictally.  
- **Imaging (MRI/CT)**: Rules out structural causes, especially in focal epilepsy.  
- **Metabolic tests**: Exclude electrolyte imbalances, infections.  

**Management**  
- **First-line AEDs**:  
  - **Focal/generalized tonic-clonic**: Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, valproate (avoid in women of childbearing age).  
  - **Absence**: Ethosuximide or valproate.  
  - **Myoclonic**: Valproate or levetiracetam.  
- **Surgery**: For drug-resistant focal epilepsy (e.g., hippocampal sclerosis).  
- **Lifestyle**: Avoid triggers, driving restrictions (var

### Summary of Epilepsy

**Definition and Prevalence**: Epilepsy is characterized by the tendency to have unprovoked seizures due to abnormal, excessive, or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. The lifetime risk of an isolated seizure is about 5%, with the highest incidence at the extremes of age. The prevalence of active epilepsy varies globally, around 0.5% in European countries.

**Classification of Seizures**: The 2017 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification categorizes seizures into generalized onset (motor and non-motor/absence), focal onset (motor and non-motor), and unknown onset. Understanding the seizure type is crucial for diagnosis and management.

**Pathophysiology**: Seizures result from an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. Factors such as genetic predisposition, structural lesions, and metabolic disturbances can contribute to this imbalance.

**Clinical Features**: Seizures can manifest in various ways, including tonic-clonic seizures, absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, and focal seizures with or without impaired awareness. The clinical presentation depends on the seizure type and the area of the brain involved.

**Epilepsy Syndromes**: Many patients with epilepsy can be classified into specific electroclinical syndromes based on seizure type, age of onset, and treatment responsiveness. Examples include childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis.

**Investigations**: Diagnosis involves a detailed history, clinical examination, EEG, and neuroimaging (MRI or CT). EEG helps assess seizure type and guide therapy, while imaging identifies structural causes.

**Management**: 
1. **Lifestyle Advice**: Patients are advised on safety measures, such as avoiding hazardous activities and following driving regulations.
2. **Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)**: The choice of AED depends on seizure type and epilepsy syndrome. Common first-line AEDs include lamotrigine for focal epilepsies and valproate for generalized epilepsies, though valproate's use is restricted in women of childbearing age due to teratogenic risks.
3. **Monitoring Therapy**: Serum level monitoring is generally not necessary unless there's doubt about adherence.
4. **Epilepsy Surgery**: Considered for drug-resistant epilepsy to resect epileptogenic brain tissue.
5. **Withdrawing AEDs**: Can be considered after 2 years of seizure freedom, with a gradual reduction in dosage.

**Prognosis**: The outcome is generally good, with about 70% achieving full control of seizures. The presence of a structural lesion can reduce the likelihood of seizure freedom.

**Special Considerations**: 
- **Pregnancy and Reproduction**: Pre-conception counseling is crucial. AEDs carry teratogenic risks, and management should balance seizure control with minimizing fetal risks.
- **Status Epilepticus**: A medical emergency requiring prompt treatment.
- **Non-Epileptic Attack Disorder (NEAD)**: Attacks resembling epileptic seizures but without EEG abnormalities, managed with psychotherapy.

### Key Points for Management and Prognosis
- Accurate diagnosis and classification are crucial.
- AED choice is tailored to seizure type and patient factors.
- Lifestyle adjustments and safety measures are important.
- Regular follow-up and adjustment of treatment plans as necessary.
- Consideration of epilepsy surgery for drug-resistant cases.
- Careful management during pregnancy and consideration of teratogenic risks.

Understanding and managing epilepsy requires a comprehensive approach that includes accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment, lifestyle advice, and consideration of the patient's overall health and specific circumstances.
