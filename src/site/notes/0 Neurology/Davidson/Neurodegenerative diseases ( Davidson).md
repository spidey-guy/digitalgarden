While MS is the most common cause of disability in young people in the UK, vascular and neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly important in later life. The neurodegenerative diseases are united in having a pathological process that leads to specic neuronal death, causing relentlessly progressive symptoms, with incidence rising with age. The causes are not yet known, although genetic inuences are important. Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease are the most common.

# Movement disorders
Movement disorders present with a wide range of symptoms. They may be genetic or acquired, and the most important is Parkinson’s disease. Most movement disorders are categorised clinically, with few conrmatory investigations available other than for those with a known gene abnormality

## Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease
Parkinsonism is a clinical syndrome characterised primarily by bradykinesia, with associated increased tone (rigidity), tremor and loss of postural reexes. There are many causes (Box 28.51) but the most common is Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD has an annual incidence of about 18/100 000 in the UK and a prevalence of about 180/100 000. Age has a critical inuence on incidence and prevalence, the latter rising to 300–500/100 000 after 80 years of age. The global prevalence of PD (over 6 million in 2016) more than doubled between 1990 and 2016 with increases across all socio-demographic regions of the world, related mainly to increasing age and longer disease duration. Average age of onset is about 60 years and fewer than 5% of patients present under the age of 40. Genetic factors are increasingly recognised and several single genes causing parkinsonism have been identied. Monogenic Parkinson’s disease can be caused by mutations in SNCA (which encode alpha-synuclein), as well as Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1 and many more, although overall monogenic disease accounts for a very small proportion of cases overall. Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the most frequent genetic cause of late-onset PD. Having a rst-degree relative with PD confers a 2–3 times increased risk of developing the disorder. It is progressive and incurable, with a variable prognosis. While motor symptoms are the most common presenting features, non-motor symptoms (particularly cognitive impairment, depression and anxiety) become increasingly prominent as the disease progresses, and signicantly reduce quality of life.

### Pathophysiology 
Although mutations in several genes have been identied in a few cases, in most patients the cause remains unknown. The discovery that methyl-phenyl-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) caused severe parkinsonism in young drug users suggested that PD might be due to an environmental toxin but none has been convincingly identied. The pathological hallmarks of PD are depletion of the pigmented dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of α-synuclein and other protein inclusions in nigral cells (Lewy bodies; Fig. 28.30). It is thought that environmental or genetic factors alter the α-synuclein protein, rendering it toxic and leading to Lewy body formation within the nigral cells. Lewy bodies are also found in the basal ganglia, brainstem and cortex, and increase with disease progression. PD is recognised as a synucleinopathy alongside multiple system atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies. The loss of dopaminergic neurotransmission is responsible for many of the clinical features.

### Clinical features 
Non-motor symptoms, including reduction in sense of smell (hyposmia), anxiety/depression, constipation and REM sleep behavioural disturbance (RBD), may precede the development of typical motor features by many years but patients rarely present at this stage. The motor symptoms are almost always initially asymmetrical. The hallmark is bradykinesia, leading to classic symptoms such as increasingly small handwriting (‘micrographia’), difculty tying shoelaces or buttoning clothes, and difculty rolling over in bed. Tremor is an early feature but may not be present in at least 20% of people with PD. It is typically a unilateral rest tremor affecting limbs, jaw and chin but not the head. In some patients tremor remains the dominant symptom for many years. Rigidity causes stiffness and a exed posture. Although postural righting reexes are impaired early on in the disease, falls tend not to occur until later. As the disease advances, speech becomes softer and indistinct. There are a number of abnormalities on neurological examination (Box 28.52). Although features are initially unilateral, gradual bilateral involvement
evolves with time. Cognition is spared in early disease; if impaired, it should trigger consideration of alternative diagnoses, such as dementia with Lewy bodies.

#### Non-motor symptoms 
While non-motor symptoms may precede the onset of more typical symptoms by many years, for most patients these features become increasingly common and disabling as PD progresses. Cognitive impairment, including dementia, is the symptom most likely to impair quality of life for patients and their carers. Estimates of dementia frequency range from 30% to 80%, depending on denitions and length of follow-up. Other distressing non-motor symptoms include neuropsychiatric features (anxiety, depression, apathy, hallucinosis/psychosis), sleep disturbance and hypersomnolence, fatigue, pain, sphincter disturbance and constipation, sexual problems (erectile failure, loss of libido or hypersexuality), drooling and weight loss.

### Investigations 
The diagnosis is clinical. Structural imaging (CT or MRI) is usually normal for age and thus rarely helpful, although it may support a suspected vascular cause of parkinsonism. Functional dopaminergic imaging (SPECT or PET) is abnormal, even in the early stages (Fig. 28.31), but does not differentiate between the different forms of degenerative parkinsonism (see Box 28.51) and so is not specic for PD. In younger patients, specic investigations may be appropriate (e.g. exclusion of Huntington’s or Wilson’s diseases). Some patients with family histories may wish to consider genetic testing, although the role of genetic counselling is uncertain at present.

### Management
#### Drug therapy
Drug treatment for PD remains symptomatic rather than curative, and there is no evidence that any of the currently available drugs are neuroprotective. Levodopa (LD) remains the most effective treatment available but other agents include dopamine agonists, anticholinergics, inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAOI)-B and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and amantadine. Debate continues about when and what treatment should be started. In general, most specialists recommend initiating treatment when symptoms are impacting on everyday life, although some favour treatment as soon as the diagnosis is made. Whether it is best to start with LD, a dopamine agonist or MAOI-B remains unclear but most accept that the most effective, best-tolerated and cheapest drug is LD. Many motor symptoms, such as tremor, freezing, falling, head-drop and abnormal exion, are quite resistant to treatment. Some non-motor symptoms, such as anxiety or depression, may respond to drug or non-drug treatments. In the UK, rivastigmine is licensed for use in PD-associated dementia, although its effect is modest. Many other non-motor symptoms are resistant to treatment. Drugs for PD should not be stopped abruptly, as this can precipitate malignant hyperthermia.

##### Levodopa 
Levodopa is the precursor to dopamine. When administered orally, more than 90% is decarboxylated to dopamine peripherally in the gastrointestinal tract and blood vessels, and only a small proportion reaches the brain. This peripheral conversion is responsible for the high frequency of adverse effects. To avoid this, LD is combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDI); the inhibitor does not cross the blood–brain barrier, thus avoiding unwanted decarboxylation-blocking in the brain. Two DDIs, carbidopa and benserazide, are available as combination preparations with LD (Sinemet and Madopar, respectively). LD is most effective for relieving akinesia and rigidity; tremor
response is often less satisfactory and it has no effect on many motor (posture, freezing) and non-motor symptoms. Failure of akinesia/rigidity to respond to LD (1000 mg/day) should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis. Although controlled-release versions of LD exist, these are usually best reserved for use overnight, as their variable bioavailability makes them difcult to use throughout the day. Madopar is also available as a dispersible tablet for more rapid-onset effect. Adverse effects include postural hypotension, nausea and vomiting, which may be offset by domperidone, though this is only prescribed for brief periods, if essential, given the risk of prolonged QTc interval and arrhythmia. LD may exacerbate or trigger hallucinations, and abnormal LD-seeking behaviour (dopamine dysregulation syndrome), in which the patient takes excessive doses of LD, may occur uncommonly. As PD progresses, the response to LD becomes less predictable in
many patients, leading to motor uctuations. This end-of-dose deterioration is due to progressive loss of dopamine storage capacity by dwindling numbers of striatonigral neurons. LD-induced involuntary movements (dyskinesia) may occur as a peak-dose phenomenon or as a biphasic phenomenon (occurring during both the build-up and wearing-off phases). More complex uctuations present as sudden, unpredictable changes in response, in which periods of parkinsonism (‘off’ phases) alternate with improved mobility but with dyskinesias (‘on’ phases). Motor complication management is difcult; wearing-off effects may respond to increased dose or frequency of LD or the addition of a COMT inhibitor (see below). More complex uctuations may be improved by the addition of dopamine agonists (including continuous infusion of apomorphine), use of intraintestinal LD via a percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy, or deep brain stimulator implantation.

##### Dopamine receptor agonists 
Originally introduced in the hope of delaying the initiation of LD and thus delaying motor complications, several dopamine agonists are available, and may be delivered orally, transdermally, sublingually, intranasally or subcutaneously (Box 28.53). The ergot-derived agonists are no longer recommended because of
rare but serious brotic side-effects. With the exception of apomorphine, all the agonists are considerably less effective than LD in relieving parkinsonism, have more adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, disorientation and hallucinations, impulse control disorders) and are more expensive. Their role in the management of PD (monotherapy or adjunctive) remains uncertain, and evidence suggests that their usefulness as initial monotherapy is short-lasting.

##### MAOI-B inhibitors 
Monoamine oxidase type B facilitates breakdown of excess dopamine in the synapse. Two inhibitors are used in PD: selegiline and rasagiline. The effects of both are modest, although usually well tolerated. Neither is neuroprotective, despite initial hopes.

##### COMT inhibitors 
Catechol-O-methyl-transferase (along with dopa decarboxylase) is involved in peripheral breakdown of LD. Three inhibitors are available: entacapone, opicapone and tolcapone (which also inhibits central COMT). Entacapone has a modest effect and is most useful for early wearing-off. It is available either as a single tablet taken with each LD/DDI dose, or as a combination tablet with LD and DDI. The more potent tolcapone is less used because of rare but serious hepatotoxicity. Opicapone, the newest of the three, is available as a once-daily drug.

##### Amantadine 
This has a mild, usually short-lived effect on bradykinesia and is rarely used unless patients are unable to tolerate other drugs. It is more commonly employed as a treatment for LD-induced dyskinesias, although again benet is modest and short-lived. Adverse effects include livedo reticularis, peripheral oedema, delirium and other anticholinergic effects.

##### Anticholinergic drugs 
These were the main treatment for PD prior to the introduction of LD. Their role now is limited by lack of efcacy (apart from an effect on tremor sometimes) and adverse effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, delirium and hallucinosis, as well as long-term concerns regarding cognitive impairment. Several anticholinergics are available, including trihexyphenidyl (benzhexol) and orphenadrine.

#### Surgery 
Destructive neurosurgery was commonly used before the introduction of LD. In the last 20 years, stereotactic surgery has emerged and most commonly involves deep brain stimulation (DBS), rather than the destructive approach of previous eras. Various targets have been identied, including the thalamus (only effective for tremor), globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus. DBS is usually reserved for individuals with medically refractory tremor or motor uctuations, and careful patient selection is vital to success. Intracranial delivery of fetal grafts or specic growth factors remains experimental. MRI-guided ultrasound-induced thalamotomy is a relatively new treatment for tremor; long-term outcomes are not well established.

#### Physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy 
Patients at all stages of PD benet from physiotherapy, which helps reduce rigidity and corrects abnormal posture. Occupational therapists can provide equipment to help overcome functional limitations, such as rails for stairs and the toilet, and bathing equipment. Speech therapy can help where dysarthria and dysphonia interfere with communication, and advice may also be provided to those with dysphagia. As with many complex neurological disorders, patients with PD should ideally be managed by a multidisciplinary team, including PD specialist nurses.

## Other Parkinsonian syndromes
Cerebrovascular disease and drug-induced parkinsonism are the most common alternative causes of parkinsonism (see Box 28.51). There are several degenerative conditions that cause parkinsonism, including multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. They typically have a more rapid progression than PD and tend to be resistant to treatment with LD. They are dened pathologically and identication during life is difcult. There are other conditions that may rarely manifest as parkinsonism, including Huntington’s and Wilson’s diseases.

### Multiple system atrophy
Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is characterised by parkinsonism, autonomic failure and cerebellar symptoms, with either parkinsonism (MSAP) or cerebellar features (MSA-C) predominating. It is much less common than PD, with a prevalence of about 4/100 000. Although early distinction between PD and MSA-P may be difcult, early falls, postural instability and lack of response to LD are clues. The pathological hallmark is α-synuclein-containing glial cytoplasmic inclusions found in the basal ganglia, cerebellum and motor cortex. Management is symptomatic and the prognosis is less good than for PD, with mean survival from symptom onset of fewer than 10 years and early disability. Cognition is usually unaffected.

### Progressive supranuclear palsy 
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) presents with symmetrical parkinsonism, cognitive impairment, early falls and bulbar symptoms. The characteristic eye movement disorder, with slowed vertical saccades leading to impairment of up- and down-gaze, may take years to emerge. PSP has different pathological features, being associated with abnormal accumulation of tau (τ) proteins and degeneration of the substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus and mid-brain. It is therefore considered a tauopathy rather than synucleinopathy. The prevalence is about 5/100 000, with average survival similar to that in MSA. There is no treatment, and the parkinsonism usually does not respond to LD.

### Corticobasal degeneration 
Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is less common than MSA or PSP, and the clinical manifestations are variable, including parkinsonism,dystonia, myoclonus and ‘alien limb’ phenomenon, whereby a limb (usually upper) moves about or interferes with the other limb without apparent conscious control. Cortical symptoms, including dementia and especially apraxia, are common and may be the only features in some cases. A number of other diseases may present with a corticobasal syndrome, including other dementias. CBD is a tauopathy with widespread deposition throughout the brain and has similar survival rates to MSA and PSP.

### Wilson’s disease
This is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutation in the ATP7B gene, causing a defect of copper metabolism (p. 907). It is a treatable cause of various movement disorders, including tremor, dystonia, parkinsonism and ataxia; psychiatric symptoms may also occur. Wilson’s disease should always be excluded in patients under the age of 50 presenting with any movement disorder.

### Huntington’s disease 
Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder, presenting in adults usually but occasionally in children. It is due to expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat in the Huntingtin gene on chromosome 4 (see Box 3.2). The disease frequently demonstrates the phenomenon of anticipation, in which there is a younger age at onset as the disease is passed through generations, due to progressive expansion of the repeat. The prevalence is about 4–8/100 000.

#### Clinical features
HD typically presents with a progressive behavioural disturbance, abnormal movements (usually chorea) and cognitive impairment leading to dementia. Onset under 18 years is rare but patients may then present with parkinsonism rather than chorea (the ‘Westphal variant’). There is always a family history, although this may not always be apparent and can sometimes be concealed.

#### Investigations and management 
The diagnosis is conrmed by genetic testing; pre-symptomatic testing for other family members is available but must be preceded by appropriate counselling. Brain imaging may show caudate atrophy but is not a reliable test. There are a number of HD mimics. Management is symptomatic, though antisense oligonucleotide therapy to reduce the Huntingtin gene (HTT) product is currently being trialled. The chorea may respond to neuroleptics such as risperidone or sulpiride, or tetrabenazine. Depression and anxiety are common and may be helped by medication.

# Ataxias
The ataxias are a heterogeneous group of inherited and acquired disorders, presenting either with pure ataxia or in association with other neurological and non-neurological features. The differential is wide (Boxes 28.54 and 28.55), and diagnosis is guided by age of onset, evolution and clinical features. A signicant proportion of cases remain idiopathic despite investigation. The hereditary ataxias are a group of inherited disorders in which degenerative changes occur to varying extents in the cerebellum, brainstem, pyramidal tracts, spinocerebellar tracts and optic and peripheral nerves, and inuence the clinical manifestations. Onset ranges from infancy to adulthood, with recessive, sex-linked or dominant inheritance (see Box 28.55). While the genetic abnormality has been identied for some, allowing diagnostic testing, this is not currently the case for many of the hereditary ataxias.

# Tremor disorders
Tremor is a feature of many disorders but the most important clinical syndromes are PD, essential tremor, drug-induced tremors (Box 28.56) and functional (psychogenic) tremors.
## 28.56 Drug-induced tremor (usually postural)*
 β-agonists (e.g. salbutamol) 
 Theophylline 
 Sodium valproate 
 Thyroxine 
 Lithium
 Tricyclic antidepressants 
 Recreational drugs (e.g. amphetamines)
 Alcohol 
 Caffeine

## Essential tremor
This has a prevalence of about 300/100 000 and may display a dominant pattern of inheritance, although no genes have thus far been identied. It may present at any age with a bilateral arm tremor (8–10 Hz), rarely at rest but typical with movement. The head and voice may be involved. The tremor improves in about 50% of patients with small amounts of alcohol. There are no specic tests and essential tremor should be distinguished from other tremor syndromes, including dystonic tremor. Betablockers and primidone are sometimes helpful, and DBS of the thalamus is an effective treatment for severe cases.

# Dystonia
Dystonia is characterised by a focal increase in tone affecting muscles in the limbs or trunk. It may be a feature of a number of neurological conditions (PD, Wilson’s disease), or occur secondary to brain damage (trauma, stroke) or drugs (tardive syndromes). Dystonia also occurs as a primary disorder. With childhood onset the cause is usually genetic and dystonia is generalised, but adult onset is usually focal; examples include a twisted neck (torticollis), repetitive blinking (blepharospasm) or tremor. Task-specic symptoms (e.g. writer's cramp, musician's dystonia) are often dystonic. Treatment is difcult but botulinum toxin injections or DBS may be useful.

# Hemifacial spasm
This usually presents after middle age with intermittent twitching around one eye, spreading ipsilaterally to other facial muscles. The spasms are exacerbated by talking, eating and stress. Hemifacial spasm is usually idiopathic, similar to trigeminal neuralgia; it has been suggested that it may be due to an aberrant arterial loop irritating the 7th nerve just outside the pons. It may, however, be symptomatic and secondary to structural lesions. Drug treatment is not effective but injections of botulinum toxin into affected muscles help, although these usually have to be repeated every 3 months or so. In refractory cases, microvascular decompression may be considered.

# Motor neuron disease
Motor neuron disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative condition caused by loss of upper and lower motor neurons in the spinal cord, cranial nerve nuclei and motor cortex. Annual incidence is about 2/100 000, with a prevalence of about 7/100 000. Most cases are sporadic but 10% of cases are familial and mutations in C9orf72 (repeat expansion), SOD1, VCP, FUS and TARDBP/TDP43 are found in many of these monogenic cases and may inuence clinical phenotype and course, in particular overlap with frontotemporal dementia. The most common form of MND (Fig. 28.32) is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and many use the terms MND and ALS interchangeably. ALS is characterised by a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs; there are rarer, pure lower (progressive muscular atrophy) or upper (progressive lateral sclerosis) motor neuron variants of MND. The average age of onset is 65, with 10% presenting before 45 years.

## [[0 Neurology/Davidson/Attachments/Davidson Neurology 24.webp|Fig. 28.32 Patterns of involvement in motor neuron disease.]]
## Clinical features 
Diagnosis can be difcult and is often delayed. MND typically presents
focally, either with limb onset (e.g. foot drop or loss of manual dexterity) or with bulbar symptoms (dysarthria, swallowing difculty); respiratory onset is rare but type II respiratory failure is a common cause of death. Sensory, autonomic and visual symptoms do not occur, although cramp is common (Box 28.57). Examination reveals a combination of lower and upper motor neuron signs (e.g. brisk reexes in wasted, fasciculating muscles) without sensory involvement (see Fig. 28.32). Cognitive impairment is under-recognised in MND: up to 50% will have a mainly executive impairment on formal testing, and around 10% develop a frontotemporal dementia (FTD). About 10% of patients presenting with FTD will develop ALS within a few years of dementia onset. Even with treatment, MND is relentlessly progressive, but median survival is improved with specialist follow-up offering non-invasive ventilation, feeding measures and access to pharmacological treatment.

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Course</mark> 
	 Symptoms often begin focally in one part and spread gradually but relentlessly to become widespread

## Investigations
Clinical features are often typical but alternative diagnoses should be excluded. Exclusion of treatable causes, such as immune-mediated multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block (p. 1192) and cervical myeloradiculopathy, is essential. Blood tests are usually normal, other than a mildly raised creatine kinase. Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies are normal but there may be reduction in amplitude of motor action potentials due to axonal loss. EMG will usually conrm the typical features of widespread denervation and re-innervation. Spinal uid analysis is not usually necessary. Genetic testing is increasing in importance, with mutations found in SOD1, FUS, TARDBP and C9orf72 that may help predict risk of disease in those with a family history of MND.

## Management
Patients should be managed within a multidisciplinary service, including physiotherapists, speech and occupational therapists, dietitians, ventilatory and feeding support, and palliative care teams, with neurological and respiratory input. Riluzole, a glutamate release antagonist, is licensed for ALS but has only a modest effect, prolonging median survival by about 2–3 months. Non-invasive ventilation signicantly prolongs survival and improves or
maintains quality of life in people with ALS. Survival and some measures of quality of life are signicantly improved in the subgroup of people with better baseline bulbar function but not in those with severe bulbar impairment. Feeding by percutaneous gastrostomy may improve quality of life and prolong survival, even when done at a late stage. Rapid access to palliative care teams is essential for patients as they enter the terminal stages of MND.

# Spinal muscular atrophy
This is a group of genetically determined recessive disorders affecting spinal and cranial lower motor neurons, characterised by proximal and distal wasting, fasciculation and weakness of muscles. Most SMA cases are caused by a defective SMN1 gene. Involvement is usually symmetrical but occasional localised forms occur. With the exception of the infantile form, progression is slow and the prognosis better than for MND. Sophisticated nucleic acid-based therapies for the treatment of SMA have shown signicant promise. Intrathecally delivered antisense oligonucleotide therapies can partially correct this SMN1 genetic defect and show clinical efcacy in severe forms of the disease.

# Summary

## Qwen 3 235b
**Summary of Neurodegenerative and Movement Disorders (Davidson)**  

### **Overview**  
Neurodegenerative diseases cause progressive neuronal death, leading to irreversible symptoms that increase with age. Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the most common. Vascular and neurodegenerative conditions become more significant in later life, contrasting with multiple sclerosis (MS), which primarily affects younger individuals.  

---

### **Parkinson’s Disease (PD)**  
- **Epidemiology**: Annual incidence ~18/100,000; prevalence ~180/100,000 (rises to 300–500/100,000 after age 80). Global prevalence doubled since 1990 due to aging populations.  
- **Pathophysiology**: Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and α-synuclein accumulation (Lewy bodies). Genetic links include SNCA, Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, and LRRK2 (most common late-onset).  
- **Clinical Features**:  
  - **Motor**: Bradykinesia (micrographia, difficulty with fine movements), rigidity (flexed posture), rest tremor (unilateral, “pill-rolling”), postural instability (falls later in disease).  
  - **Non-motor**: Hyposmia, depression/anxiety, constipation, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), cognitive decline (dementia in 30–80% of patients).  
- **Investigations**: Clinical diagnosis; functional imaging (SPECT/PET) shows dopaminergic deficits but lacks specificity. Genetic testing for familial cases.  
- **Management**:  
  - **Drugs**: Levodopa (most effective, combined with DDI like carbidopa/benserazide), dopamine agonists (e.g., ropinirole), MAOI-B (selegiline), COMT inhibitors (entacapone).  
  - **Surgery**: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for motor fluctuations or tremor.  
  - **Non-pharmacologic**: Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy. Multidisciplinary care is critical.  

---

### **Other Parkinsonian Syndromes**  
1. **Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)**: Parkinsonism + autonomic failure/cerebellar symptoms; poor response to levodopa; survival <10 years.  
2. **Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)**: Symmetrical parkinsonism, early falls, vertical gaze palsy, cognitive impairment; tauopathy; no effective treatment.  
3. **Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD)**: Asymmetrical parkinsonism, dystonia, myoclonus, “alien limb” phenomenon; tauopathy; similar survival to MSA/PSP.  
4. **Wilson’s Disease**: Treatable autosomal recessive copper metabolism disorder; parkinsonism, dystonia, psychiatric symptoms. Exclude in <50-year-olds with movement disorders.  
5. **Huntington’s Disease (HD)**: Autosomal dominant CAG repeat expansion in HTT gene; chorea, behavioral changes, dementia; anticipation (earlier onset in successive generations).  

---

### **Ataxias**  
- **Acquired Causes**: Alcohol, drugs (e.g., lithium, antiepileptics), vitamin deficiencies (B1/E), infections (HIV, Whipple’s), multiple sclerosis, stroke.  
- **Inherited Ataxias**:  
  - **Autosomal Dominant**: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), episodic ataxias.  
  - **Autosomal Recessive**: Friedreich’s ataxia (cardiac involvement, diabetes), ataxia-telangiectasia (immune deficiency, malignancy risk).  
  - **X-linked**: Fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), adrenoleukodystrophy.  
- **Management**: Symptomatic; genetic testing for some subtypes.  

---

### **Tremor Disorders**  
- **Essential Tremor**: Common (300/100,000); bilateral arm tremor (8–10 Hz), alcohol-responsive; treated with beta-blockers (propranolol) or primidone.  
- **Drug-induced Tremor**: Caused by β-agonists, valproate, lithium, antidepressants, caffeine.  
- **Surgical Option**: Thalamic DBS for severe cases.  

---

### **Dystonia**  
- **Types**: Primary (e.g., torticollis, blepharospasm) or secondary (PD, Wilson’s, drugs).  
- **Management**: Botulinum toxin injections, DBS.  

---

### **Motor Neuron Disease (MND/ALS)**  
- **Epidemiology**: Incidence ~2/100,000; 10% familial (mutations in C9orf72, SOD1, FUS).  
- **Features**: Upper/lower motor neuron signs (muscle wasting, fasciculations, spasticity), bulbar/respiratory involvement, cognitive impairment (50% with executive dysfunction; 10% develop frontotemporal dementia).  
- **Management**: Riluzole (modest survival benefit), non-invasive ventilation, gastrostomy, multidisciplinary palliative care.  

---

### **Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)**  
- **Cause**: SMN1 gene mutation (autosomal recessive).  
- **Features**: Symmetrical muscle weakness/wasting; slower progression than MND.  
- **Treatment**: Antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., nusinersen) and gene therapies (e.g., onasemnogene abeparvovec).  

---

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Diagnosis**: Clinical, with limited confirmatory tests (except genetic testing for familial cases).  
- **Management**: Symptomatic; multidisciplinary teams are essential.  
- **Prognosis**: Variable; PD has slower progression, while MSA, PSP, and CBD progress rapidly. MND is fatal (median survival 2–5 years).  

**Note**: Differentiating PD from other parkinsonian syndromes relies on response to levodopa, presence of non-motor features (e.g., early dementia in DLB), and specific signs (e.g., vertical gaze palsy in PSP).

**Summary of Neurodegenerative Diseases (Davidson):**

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), are characterized by progressive neuronal loss, with incidence rising with age. While their exact causes remain unclear, genetic factors play a significant role. PD, the most common movement disorder, presents with bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability, alongside non-motor symptoms like cognitive decline and depression. Pathologically, PD involves dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra and Lewy body formation. Treatment is symptomatic, primarily using levodopa, dopamine agonists, and deep brain stimulation (DBS) for advanced cases. Other parkinsonian syndromes include **multiple system atrophy (MSA)**, **progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)**, and **corticobasal degeneration (CBD)**, which are typically less responsive to therapy.

**Ataxias** arise from cerebellar dysfunction and can be acquired (e.g., drug toxicity, stroke) or inherited (e.g., Friedreich’s ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxias). **Essential tremor**, a common movement disorder, often improves with beta-blockers or primidone. **Dystonia** involves involuntary muscle contractions and may be treated with botulinum toxin or DBS. **Motor neuron disease (MND)**, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), manifests with upper and lower motor neuron signs, progressive weakness, and respiratory failure. Management focuses on multidisciplinary care, riluzole, and non-invasive ventilation. **Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)**, a genetic disorder affecting motor neurons, now has emerging therapies like antisense oligonucleotides.

Key themes include the progressive nature of these diseases, the importance of genetic and clinical diagnosis, and the limited but evolving treatment options.
