A stroke is a sudden onset focal cerebral dysfunction due to vascu lar disease of the brain (Fig. 29.1). Stroke is the third most common cause of disability in the world after ischaemic heart disease and con genital disorders. In Europe, most strokes (about 80%) are caused by cerebral ischaemia and fewer are due to haemorrhage, although there are probably a similar number of deaths due to ischaemic and haemor rhagic stroke worldwide. Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) are discussed later in this chapter. Vascular dementia is described on page 1246.

# Functional anatomy and physiology
The paired internal carotid and vertebral arteries supply blood to the brain. Each internal carotid artery bifurcates into the anterior and middle cerebral arteries which supply the anterior cerebrum (‘anterior circulation’). The vertebral arteries join to form the basilar artery (supplying the brainstem, cerebellum and pons) which bifurcates into the posterior cerebral arteries which supply the posterior cerebrum (‘posterior circulation’) (Fig. 29.2). The function of each brain area is described on page 1122. Communicating arteries connect the anterior with the posterior and the left with the right circulations. These anastomoses form the circle of Willis that – if complete – maintains cerebral circulation even if one carotid or vertebral artery is blocked. In health, autoregulation maintains a constant cerebral blood ow across a wide range of arterial blood pressures to meet the high cere bral metabolic activity. This autoregulatory mechanism can be disrupted after stroke. The venous system is formed by a collection of sinuses over the surface of the brain which drain into the jugular veins (Fig. 29.3).

# Investigations
## Brain imaging
Brain imaging helps to determine the cause of stroke symptoms. Non contrast (unenhanced) computed tomography (CT) scanning is rapid, sensitive for intracranial haemorrhage and can show cerebral ischaemia or other diagnoses, but does use ionising radiation. In patients with a clinical diagnosis of an acute stroke, a CT scan that shows no intra cerebral haemorrhage makes an ischaemic stroke the likelier diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than CT for changes of cerebral ischaemia and provides very detailed images of brain anatomy, although it takes longer than CT to perform (Fig. 29.4). MRI uses powerful magnets that can interfere with medical devices (such as pacemakers) or metal implants, and can be claustrophobic for patients. Diffusionweighted MRI adds sensitivity for cerebral ischaemia compared with other MRI sequences.

## Vascular imaging
Imaging of the carotid artery and of intra and extracranial vessels can inuence practice by demonstrating carotid stenosis which guides decisions about carotid endarterectomy, and by showing major vessel occlusion in acute stroke which guides decisions about thrombectomy. The rstline imaging techniques for vessels supplying the brain can
be ultrasound, CT angiography or MR angiography, depending on avail ability and expertise. Intraarterial angiography is used less frequently as a primary investigation, although it is often done during neurointerven tional procedures to conrm ndings from noninvasive techniques or guide treatment (Fig. 29.5). Vascular imaging can show also major ves sel dissection, changes of cerebral vasculitis, intracranial aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations. Transcranial Doppler sonography is used in some centres to identify intracranial stenosis or occlusion.
### Fig. 29.5 Different techniques for imaging blood vessels
[[0 Neurology/Davidson/Attachments/Davidson stroke 4.jpg|Fig. 29.5 Different techniques for imaging blood vessels]]

## Blood tests
The choice of blood tests should be guided by the clinical situation. A full blood count, electrolytes and renal function are usually indicated. Blood glucose (usually fasting) can diagnose unrecognised diabetes (or poor diabetes control), lipids (cholesterol fractions and triglycerides) may guide lipidlowering therapy, and Creactive protein or erythrocyte sedimenta tion rate may identify an inammatory response (for example in giant cell arteritis or endocarditis).
Monogenic disorders are a rare cause of stroke, and genetic testing
is usually guided by particular clinical or radiological syndromes (e.g. cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, CADASIL), but needs careful discussion with patients and families so the implications of a genetic diagnosis are understood.
## Lumbar puncture
Cerebrospinal uid can show evidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage, but is not used for most stroke patients.
## Cardiac investigations
A 12lead ECG may show atrial brillation (AF), an important stroke risk factor, evidence of prolonged hypertension (left ventricular hypertrophy), or previous myocardial infarction. Prolonged ECG monitoring may reveal short periods of AF (‘paroxysmal’ AF), which leads to anticoagulation for prevention of future ischaemic stroke. Management can change when an echocardiogram shows a righttoleft shunt (e.g. a patent foramen ovale), endocarditis or a cardiac tumour.
# Presenting problems
Most strokes develop suddenly within a matter of minutes or hours, and are one of the differential diagnoses of patients with almost any acute focal neurological presentation.
## Weakness
In severe stroke, involvement of large areas of the cortex or smaller areas of the deep white matter in the cerebrum or brainstem leads to a hemi paresis (see Fig. 28.17). Other patterns of weakness include: face only (usually an upper motor neuron pattern affecting the lower face only); face and arm; leg only (anterior cerebral artery involvement); hand only (often a clumsiness); or a quadraparesis (with brainstem stroke).
## Speech disturbance
Stroke can lead to a number of speech abnormalities. Cortical strokes (usually dominant frontal or parietal lobe) can cause dysphasia, with dif culties understanding speech (a receptive dysphasia) or difculties pro ducing grammatically correct speech (an expressive dysphasia). Stroke in the cortex, deep white matter, cerebellum or brainstem can lead to slurred speech (dysarthria). More rarely, isolated difculties with reading (alexia) or writing (agraphia) occur, but they are more usually associated with other symptoms (see Box 28.2).
## Visual decit
Occlusion of the ophthalmic artery by thrombus leads to sudden blindness in one eye. If the blindness is transient, this is called ‘tran sient monocular blindness’ or ‘amaurosis fugax’. These symptoms should lead to a similar search for risk factors and cause as stroke symptoms. Stroke affecting the occipital lobe or optic tracts or radiation leads
to a contralateral hemianopia or, in smaller lesions, a partial eld defect (see p. 1145).
## Visuo-spatial dysfunction
Damage to the nondominant cortex often results in contralateral visuospatial dysfunction, e.g. sensory or visual neglect and apraxia (inability to perform complex tasks despite normal motor, sensory and cerebellar function). Confusion or dysphasia after stroke are sometimes misdiagnosed as delirium.
## Ataxia
Stroke causing damage to the cerebellum and its connections can present with an acute ataxia and there may be associated brainstem features such as diplopia and vertigo. The differential diagnosis includes vestibular disorders.
## Headache
Sudden severe headache is the cardinal symptom of SAH but also occurs in intracerebral haemorrhage. Although headache is common in acute ischaemic stroke, it is rarely a dominant feature.. Headache also occurs in cerebral venous thrombosis and in giant cell arteritis. Migraine is a weak risk factor for stroke, and sometimes a stroke can precipitate a migraine attack.
## Seizure
Epileptic seizures are unusual in acute ischaemic stroke. Focal onset seizures can occur during stroke recovery, or during acute intracerebral haemorrhage or acute cerebral venous thrombosis (particularly of the cortical veins).
## Coma
If a stroke patient presents with coma, it is usually due to a large intracerebral haemorrhage or brainstem stroke. Cortical ischaemic stroke patients can become comatose if they develop space occupying cerebral oedema, or develop complications of stroke such as pneumonia (see Box 9.31).

# Stroke
Stroke is a common medical emergency. In the UK about 150 per 100 000 people have a stroke each year. It is commoner with increasing age, greater poverty and with vascular risk factors (Box. 29.1).

## Pathophysiology
### Cerebral infarction
Cerebral infarction is usually due to atherothromboembolism. The source of embolism can be the heart, particularly when there is AF, or the rup ture of large artery atherosclerosis and subsequent thromboembolism from carotid arteries, vertebral arteries and aortic arch. Intracranial ath eroma can lead to in situ thrombosis. Occlusion of the small perforating lenticulostriate arteries in patients with sporadic or genetic small ves sel diseases leads to ‘lacunar’ infarctions. Spontaneous cervical artery dissection is an important mechanism in younger people. Infarction can also be the result of low arterial ow, for example severe hypotension (sometimes intraoperative), vessel inammation in children or adults with vasculitis, or failure in energy production in mitochondrial disease. After the occlusion of a cerebral artery, the supply of oxygen, glucose
and other nutrients to tissue falls, and neuronal functions begin to fail. If there are adequate collateral vessels, these may dilate and restore normal blood ow, or maintain a reduced blood ow that keeps tissue alive but not active. Cerebral tissue begins to die if there are inadequate collateral vessels, or the vessel is not reopened by endogenous thrombol ysis, thrombolytic medication or thrombectomy. The process of cell death leads to oedema of dying tissue, which can be lifethreatening if it expands to increase intracranial pressure. Although reopening blood vessels is of overall benet, restoration of blood supply can lead to a secondary injury which is most obvious clinically in haemorrhagic transformation of an infarct, which is not infrequent (~3%) after thrombolytic therapy, If the patient survives the acute stages of infarction, healing begins
with inammation to clear dying tissue, recovery of some neurons and reorganisation of some cerebral function to other brain areas.
### Intracerebral haemorrhage
The commonest cause of intracerebral haemorrhage is the rupture of small blood vessels. Small vessels can be damaged by hypertension, diabetes, amyloid deposition or genetic causes. Rupture of abnormalities of larger vessels such as arteriovenous or cavernous malformations, and sometimes intracranial aneurysms (which usually presents as SAH) can also lead to intracerebral haemorrhage (Fig. 29.6). Haemorrhage leads to harm by direct pressure of the haematoma which can continue to grow after presentation, mass effect from surrounding oedema, and inammation due to degrading blood products. Haemorrhage recovers with the resorption of blood products, resolution of oedema, healing of neurons and cerebral reorganisation (Box 29.2)

## Clinical features
Both acute stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) are characterised by a rapidonset, focal decit of brain function. Symptoms can be transient (TIA) or persistent (stroke). The symptoms of a typical stroke progress over minutes, affect an identiable area of brain and are ‘negative’ (i.e. loss of function) (Box 29.3). If symptoms progress over hours or days, or if signicant ‘positive’ features are present (e.g. spreading paraesthesiae, abnormal movements), other diagnoses are more likely (Box 29.3). Persistent or transient symptoms that cannot be localised to one brain area, e.g. syncope, amnesia, delirium and dizziness, are more likely to have causes other than TIA or stroke (see Fig. 9.4 and Box 29.4). It is important to remember that anxiety is common in people presenting with stroke or TIA, but also that people with functional neurological disorders can present with acute onset weakness or collapse (see Chapter 28). The clinical syndrome of an ischaemic stroke depends on the arte
rial territory involved and the size of the lesion (see Fig. 29.1). These will both have a bearing on management, such as suitability for carotid endarterectomy. The presence of a unilateral motor decit, a higher cer ebral function decit such as aphasia or neglect, or a visual eld defect usually places the lesion in the cerebral hemisphere. Ataxia, diplopia, vertigo or bilateral weakness usually indicates a lesion in the brainstem or cerebellum. Different combinations of these decits dene several ischaemic stroke syndromes (Fig. 29.7), which reect the site and size of the lesion and may provide clues to the underlying arterial occlusion. Reduced conscious level usually indicates a largevolume lesion in
the cerebral hemisphere but may result from a lesion in the brainstem or complications such as obstructive hydrocephalus, hypoxia or severe systemic infection (usually pneumonia). The combination of severe head ache and vomiting at the onset of the focal decit is suggestive of intra cerebral haemorrhage, although headache is also a feature of giant cell arteritis and arterial dissection. The denitions of strokes and TIA, are:
	** Transient ischaemic attack (TIA)**: a transient focal neurological dys function caused by brain or retinal ischaemia with no evidence of infarction, where symptoms resolve within 24 hours.
	** Cerebral ischaemic stroke**: acute focal neurological dysfunction caused by focal infarction at single or multiple sites of brain or retina, with evidence of infarction either from neuroimaging or symptom duration longer than 24 hours.
	** Intracerebral haemorrhage**: acute focal neurological disturbance caused by haemorrhage within the brain parenchyma or ventricular system.

### Neuroimaging
CT is the most widely available method of imaging the brain. It has reasonable sensitivity for some nonstroke lesions, such as subdural haematomas, subarachnoid haemorrhage and brain tumours, but not others, such as the changes of early multiple sclerosis. CT has a high sensitivity for acute intracranial haemorrhage (see Fig. 29.6). However, soon after symptom onset, CT changes in cerebral infarction may be absent, or very subtle. Signs of infarction develop over time but small cerebral infarcts may never show up on CT imaging. Immediate brain imaging is a help and sometimes essential (see Box 29.7). Perfusion of brain tissue can be demonstrated with CT after injection
of contrast media (i.e. CT perfusion scanning). After ischaemic stroke, this technique can identify areas of brain with low perfusion that might be reversed with thrombolysis or thrombectomy.
MRI scanning times are longer than CT, but MRI diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) can detect ischaemia earlier than CT. It may not show changes in up to a third of stroke patients (see Fig. 29.4). MRI is more sensitive than CT in detecting strokes affecting the brainstem and cer ebellum, and, unlike CT, can reliably distinguish haemorrhagic from ischaemic stroke weeks after the onset. CT and MRI may reveal clues as to the nature of the arterial lesion. For example, there may be a small, deep lacunar infarct indicating smallvessel disease, or a more periph eral infarct suggesting other causes (see Fig. 29.7). The location of an intracerebral haemorrhage might indicate the presence of an underlying vascular malformation, aneurysm or amyloid angiopathy. A ‘positive scan’ is not needed to make a diagnosis of acute ischae
mic stroke. A typical stroke syndrome with a normal CT (or a CT with no acute changes of stroke) means that an ischaemic stroke is the likeliest diagnosis. This means clinical skills are very important in stroke diagnosis.
#### 29.7 Indications for immediate brain imaging in acute stroke
 Patient on anticoagulants or with abnormal coagulation 
 Suitable for reperfusion (thrombolysis) 
 Deteriorating conscious level or rapidly progressing decits 
 Suspected cerebellar haematoma, to exclude hydrocephalus

### Vascular imaging
It is important to identify carotid stenosis in patients with recent ischae mic stroke or TIA. The presence or absence of a carotid bruit is not a reliable indicator of the degree of carotid stenosis. Carotid stenosis can be noninvasively identied with duplex ultrasound, magnetic resonance or computed tomography angiography (MRA or CTA) (see Fig. 29.5), or very occasionally with intraarterial contrast radiography. Although many patients have intracranial, vertebral artery or aortic arch atherosclero sis, at the time of writing there are no evidencedbased interventions for these lesions. In patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, imaging (MRA, CTA or CT venogaphy (CTV)) may identify an underlying macrovascular cause, e.g intracranial aneurysm, arteriovenous malfor mation (AVM), or venous sinus thrombosis (see Fig. 29.5). CTA is an important technique to demonstrate large artery occlusion to identify patients who are suitable for thrombectomy.
### Cardiac investigations
Approximately 20% of ischaemic strokes are due to embolism from the heart. The most common cause is atrial brillation, but prosthetic heart valves, endocarditis, other valve abnormalities and recent myocardial infarction may also lead to cardioembolism. Atrial brillation can be identied on a 12lead ECG, or more prolonged
ECG recording with devices that can record between a few days and many months. A transthoracic or transoesophageal echocardiogram in selected stroke patients can identify endocarditis, atrial myxoma, intra cardiac thrombus or patent foramen ovale (PFO). A PFO is a righttoleft cardiac shunt that is usually asymptomatic but can act as a conduit for thrombi from the venous system.

## Blood tests
Blood tests can identify high fasting glucose levels, anaemia, electrolyte disturbances or evidence of an inammatory response (e.g. in temporal arteritis or vasculitis). Clotting abnormalities are a rare cause of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, and tests for thrombophilia or haemophilia without other clinical pointers rarely lead to a change in management. However, in selected patients (for example those with both venous and arterial events) tests for inherited thrombophilia or antiphospholipid antibodies may be helpful. Intracranial haemorrhage is frequently due to prescribed anticoag ulants (direct oral anticoagulants or coumarins like warfarin) and monitoring may be important when reversing the effect of these agents.
## Management
Management (Fig. 29.8) is aimed at identifying the cause, minimising the volume of brain that is irreversibly damaged, preventing complications (Fig. 29.9), reducing the patient's disability and handicap through rehabil itation, and reducing the risk of recurrent stroke or other vascular events. With TIA there is no major persisting brain damage and disability, so the priority is to reduce the risk of stroke.

### Fig. 29.9 Complications of acute stroke
[[0 Neurology/Davidson/Attachments/Davidson stroke 8.jpg|Fig. 29.9 Complications of acute stroke]]

### Reperfusion (thrombolysis and thrombectomy)
Rapid reperfusion in ischaemic stroke can reduce the extent of brain damage. Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
(alteplase) improves recovery if given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset to carefully selected patients. The main contraindications to thrombolysis are a high bleeding risk (recent haemorrhage, anticoagulant therapy, recent surgery or trauma at a noncompressible site) and delay to treatment: the earlier treatment is given, the greater the benet (Fig. 29.10). Intravenous thrombolysis fails to reperfuse the brain in up to 30%
of patients presenting with a largevessel occlusion. Mechanical clot retrieval (thrombectomy) performed up to 6 hours after onset of symp toms can greatly improve the chances of avoiding disability in these patients (see Fig. 29.8 and Fig. 29.11). Treatment of patients presenting later, or where symptoms onset is unknown (e.g. waking from sleep), is possible if there is evidence of ‘salvageable’ tissue with brain imaging.

### Supportive care
Rapid admission of patients to a specialised stroke unit facilitates coor dinated care from a multidisciplinary team and reduces mortality and disability amongst survivors. For every 1000 patients managed in a stroke unit, an extra 50 will avoid death or longterm disability, com pared to those managed in nonspecialist wards. Rehabilitation should begin at the same time as acute medical management. Dysphagia is common and can be detected by an early bedside test of swallowing. This allows hydration, feeding and medication to be given safely, if nec essary by nasogastric tube. In the acute phase, a checklist may be useful (Box 29.8) to ensure that all the factors that might inuence outcome have been addressed.
Neurological decits may worsen during the rst few hours or days after their onset. This may be due to further infarction, haemorrhagic transformation of infarction (most commonly after thrombolysis), or the development of oedema with consequent mass effect. It is important to distinguish these patients from those who are deteriorating as a result of complications such as hypoxia, sepsis, epileptic seizures or metabolic abnormalities that may be reversed more easily. Patients with cerebellar haematomas or infarcts with mass effect may develop obstructive hydro cephalus and some will benet from insertion of a ventricular drain or decompressive surgery. Some patients with large haematomas or infarc tion with massive oedema in the cerebral hemispheres may benet from antioedema agents, such as mannitol, or articial ventilation. Surgical decompression with hemicraniectomy to reduce intracranial pressure should be considered in patients where survival with severe disability is acceptable and surgery is possible within 48 hours.

### Antiplatelet agents
In the absence of contraindications, aspirin (300 mg daily) should be started immediately after a major ischaemic stroke unless thrombolysis has been given, in which case it should be withheld for at least 24 hours. Aspirin reduces the risk of early ischaemic stroke recurrence and has a small but clinically worthwhile effect on disability (see Fig. 29.8 and Fig. 29.12); it may be given by rectal suppository or by nasogastric tube in dysphagic patients. In minor ischaemic stroke or TIA, two antiplatelet agents (for example clopidogrel and aspirin) for a few weeks reduce the risk of early recurrent stroke. Considerations specic to use of anticoagulants in old age are given
in Box 29.9
#### Fig. 29.12 Strategies for secondary prevention of stroke.
[[0 Neurology/Davidson/Attachments/Davidson stroke 11.jpg|Fig. 29.12 Strategies for secondary prevention of stroke.]]

#### 29.9 Anticoagulation in old age
 Randomised trials of anticoagulation versus aspirin in older people with atrial brillation demonstrate a halving of the risk of stroke from about 4% to about 2% per year. Any increased risk of bleeding is much smaller.
 **AF and increased risk of stroke:** older age and previous stroke increase the risk of stroke in the presence of atrial brillation, and bleeding risk with anticoagulation.
 **Falls risk:** older patients are more prone to falls, including head injuries, which may increase bleeding risk.

### Coagulation abnormalities
In patients with intracerebral haemorrhage, coagulation abnormalities should be reversed as quickly as possible to reduce haematoma expan sion. This is a problem in patients taking anticoagulant therapy. There is no evidence that clotting factors are useful in the absence of a clotting defect.
### Blood pressure
Early reduction of blood pressure (<180 mmHg) reduces haematoma expansion and may improve the overall outcome in patients with acute intracerebral haemorrhage. Blood pressure lowering in acute ischaemic stroke does not improve later disability, but reduces intracranial haemor rhage after thrombolysis. However, reducing blood pressure is very important in the longer term
to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.
### Management of risk factors
The approaches used are summarised in Fig. 29.12. The average risk of a further stroke is 5%–10% within the rst week of an ischaemic stroke or TIA, 15% over the rst year (including the early period) and 5% per year thereafter. Patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA should be offered long term antiplatelet drugs and statins to lower low density lipoprotein chol esterol (LDLC). For patients in atrial brillation, the risk can be reduced substantially with oral anticoagulation with direct oral anticoagulants or warfarin (in selected patients, see Box 29.9). The risk of recurrence after both ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes can be reduced by blood pressure reduction, even for those with relatively ‘normal’ blood pres sures. Patients should stop smoking. The evidence for change in diet or increasing exercise is weaker, but it is probable these interventions reduce recurrent stroke.

### Carotid endarterectomy and arterial angioplasty
Some patients with a carotid territory ischaemic stroke or TIA have >50% stenosis of the carotid artery on the side of the brain lesion. These patients have a greater than average risk of stroke recurrence. For those without major residual disability, removal of the stenosis by carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of recurrent stroke although the operation itself carries about a 3%–4% stroke risk, depending on the surgical centre. Surgery is most effective in patients with more severe stenoses (70%–99%) and when it is performed within the rst couple of weeks after the TIA or ischaemic stroke. Carotid angioplasty and stenting are technically feasible but have not been shown to be as effective as endarterectomy for the majority of eli gible patients. Endarterectomy of asymptomatic carotid stenosis reduces stroke risk. but it has a smaller absolute benet. Whilst stenting of other arteries (vertebral or intracranial) could reduce stroke incidence, at present there is no evidence to support their use in clinical practice.

### Rehabilitation
Stroke survivors are often disabled by reduced mobility or upper limb weakness, impaired communication, cognitive impairment, dyspraxia, poor coordination, or visual impairment. Around a third of patients develop dementia after stroke. A minority have persistent dysphagia and some need longterm enteral feeding with a gastrostomy tube. Other longterm stroke complications include neuropathic pain (particularly common after thalamic stroke), limb spasticity, shoulder pain, epilepsy, incontinence, fatigue and anxiety or depression. The purpose of rehabilitation is to maximise functional recovery and
prevent complications. The speed and degree of recovery varies between individuals. Severe strokes (total anterior circulation syndrome or NIHSS score >15) are more likely to cause severe disability and loss of independ ent living. Other predictors of poor recovery are older age, preexisting disability, multimorbidity and preexisting cognitive impairment. The goals set during rehabilitation should be achievable, and reached
by discussion between the patient and a multidisciplinary team on a ded icated stroke unit, including doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists and dieticians. Supportive family and social networks are important.
There are three main phases of recovery. Early recovery (rst few days)
is due to resolution of cerebral oedema and cerebral reperfusion. The second phase – ‘neuroplasticity’ – is when new areas of brain take over from damaged areas of brain. This ‘rewiring’ can occur for a year or even later after stroke but most happens within the rst few months. Intensive rehabilitation should begin as early as possible after the rst 24 hours, because very early mobilisation (<24 hr) may be harmful. Repetitive prac tice of lost skills has been shown to increase neuroplasticity. The third phase is adaptive recovery. In this period the patient may learn new strat egies to live with their disability and provision can be made for mobility aids, communication aids, or adaptations to the home. Intense therapy in the longer term may be benecial to some patients and is an area of active research. It is important not to underestimate the longterm emotional and nan cial impacts of stroke. Many stroke survivors face an initial loss of identity,
loss of income and relationship strain. It is common for stroke survivors to feel fear, anxiety, frustration, anger, sadness and a sense of grief over physical and mental losses. Stroke survivors hoping to return to educa tion or work need specialist vocational support. Barriers to effective rehabilitation include physical illness: post
stroke pneumonia or delirium, which can delay rehabilitation sessions; preexisting cognitive impairment or physical frailty; poor motivation and apathy (common in nondominant hemisphere strokes); fatigue; depression; or pain. When improvements in lost function slow down the focus of therapy shifts to adaptive recovery. Milestones can be used to discuss rehabilitation goals with patients and their carers and to set out realistic expectations for recovery. Physical milestones include sitting balance (e.g. 1 minute unsupported sit), followed by standing balance (e.g. 1 minute), followed by stepping (e.g. 10 steps on the spot) and then walking (e.g. 10 metres).
Research in technologies to assist stroke rehabilitation is ongoing,
including transcranial direct current stimulation and vagal stimulators for motor recovery and mirror therapy for limb pain and visuospatial neglect.

### Causes of ischaemic stroke
Large artery atherosclerosis, small vessel disease and cardioembolism from AF are the commonest causes of ischaemic stroke. Carotid or vert ebral artery dissection occasionally leads to stroke . The presenting hist ory often includes minor injury and face or neck pain. After conrmation on angiography (MRA or CTA), treatment is with either antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulation, (the latter are more effective). The cause of dissection is unknown in most cases, but collagen disorders, e.g. Ehlers−Danlos syndrome (type 4), are occasionally responsible. Giant cell arteritis, a vasculitis of large and mediumsized blood
vessels, may present with transient monocular blindness, usually with head tenderness, shoulder pain or jaw claudication on chewing. It is important to identify because blindness can be prevented with steroids. Other large artery vasculitis can very rarely present with stroke.
### Causes of intracerebral haemorrhage
Most intracerebral haemorrhages result from disease of the small cer ebral blood vessels, either due to sporadic small vessel disease or amyloid angiopathy. Anticoagulants, given for AF or metal prosthetic heart valves, increase the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage but almost always to a smaller degree than their reduction in the risk of ischaemic stroke.
Arteriovenous or cavernous malformations (‘cavernomas’) are more commonly discovered after intracerebral haemorrhage in younger peo ple. To reduce the risk of further haemorrhage, it is possible to treat some of these malformations with surgery or radiosurgery. Arteriovenous mal formation can be treated by surgical removal, by ligation of the blood vessels that feed or drain the lesion, or most often by radiological injec tion of material to occlude the stula or draining veins. However, treat ment of these malformations when they are asymptomatic probably leads to more harm than benet.

# Subarachnoid haemorrhage
Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) (see Fig. 29.1) affects about 6 per 100 000 of the population per year. SAH is more common in women, in older people and in those with a family history, or vascular risk fac tors (particularly smoking and hypertension). About 30% of patients with an aneurysmal SAH die within a month of their bleed; untreated survivors have a recurrence (or rebleed) rate of about 40% in the rst 4 weeks. Most (85%) SAHs are due to saccular or ‘berry’ aneurysms at bifur
cations of cerebral arteries (see Fig. 29.2), particularly in the circle of Willis. The most common sites are in the anterior communicating artery (30%), posterior communicating artery (25%) and middle cere bral artery (20%). There is an increased risk in rstdegree relatives of those with saccular aneurysms, in patients with polycystic kidney dis ease and congenital connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. A minority of SAHs are not associated with aneurysms – the clinical syndrome of ‘perimesencephalic haemorrhage’, which have a characteristic appearance on CT and a benign prognosis. Small cor tical surface SAH is thought to be due to amyloid angiopathy. Around 5% of SAHs are due to arteriovenous malformations or vertebral artery dissection.
## Clinical features
SAH usually presents with a sudden, severe, ‘thunderclap’ headache, which is usually persistent, often accompanied by vomiting, raised blood pressure and neck stiffness or pain. It can occur spontaneously, on physical exertion, straining or during sex. There may be loss of con sciousness so SAH should be considered if a patient is found coma tose. About 1 patient in 8 with a sudden severe headache has SAH and, in view of this, all who present in this way require investigation to exclude it (Fig. 29.13). On examination, the patient may be distressed, in pain, with pho
tophobia. There may be neck stiffness due to subarachnoid blood, but this may take some hours to develop. Focal hemisphere signs, such as hemiparesis or aphasia, may be present at onset if there is an associated intracerebral haematoma. A third nerve palsy may be present due to local pressure from an aneurysm of the posterior com municating artery, and patients presenting with a painful third nerve palsy should be investigated urgently for the presence of an expanding aneurysm. Fundoscopy may reveal a subhyaloid haemorrhage, which represents blood tracking along the subarachnoid space around the optic nerve.
### Fig. 29.13 Investigation of subarachnoid haemorrhage
[[0 Neurology/Davidson/Attachments/Davidson stroke 12.jpg|Fig. 29.13 Investigation of subarachnoid haemorrhage]]

## Investigations
The diagnosis of SAH can usually be made by a timely CT read by an expert radiologist but a negative result does not completely exclude it, since small amounts of blood in the subarachnoid space may not be detected by CT, especially if the presentation is delayed by more than a day (see Fig. 29.13). Lumbar puncture should be performed 12 hours after symptom onset if possible, to allow detection of xanthochromia. If either of these tests is positive, CT or digital subtraction cerebral angiog raphy (see Fig. 29.5) is needed to identify an aneurysm.
## Management
Nimodipine is given to prevent delayed cerebral ischaemia in the acute phase. Insertion of platinum coils into an aneurysm (via an endovascular procedure) or surgical clipping of the aneurysm neck reduces the risk of both early and late recurrent SAH. Coiling is associated with fewer perioperative complications and better outcomes than surgical clipping: where feasible, it is now the procedure of rst choice. Treatment may also be needed for complications of SAH, which include obstructive hydrocephalus (that may require drainage via a shunt), delayed cerebral ischaemia due to vasospasm (which may be treated with vasodilators), hyponatraemia (best managed by uid restriction) and systemic compli cations associated with immobility, such as chest infection and venous thrombosis.
### Rehabilitation
The pattern of recovery after subarachnoid haemorrhage is different to ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, perhaps due to a more widespread brain injury. Even those who make a good physical recovery from a mild SAH often have problems with headache, thinking, fatigue and change in personality. Physical disabilities due to hemiparesis, arm or leg weak ness or incoordination may relate to ischaemic or haemorrhagic lesions following aneurysm rupture.

# Cerebral venous disease
Thrombosis of the cerebral veins and venous sinuses (cerebral venous thrombosis) is much less common than arterial thrombosis. The main causes are listed in Box 29.10. It may be idiopathic, associated with pregnancy, infection of the cranial sinuses, severe dehydration, or due to other acquired or inherited thrombophilias.

Cortical vein thrombosis presents with focal cortical decits such as aphasia and hemiparesis (depending on the area affected), and epilepsy (focal or generalised). Occlusion of the larger veins may present with severe illness, but also with a milder illness of headache and papilloedema.

## Investigations and management
MR venography demonstrates a lling defect in the affected vessel. Anticoagulation, initially with heparin followed by warfarin, is benecial, even in the presence of venous haemorrhage. In selected patients, endo vascular thrombolysis has been advocated. Management of underlying causes and complications, such as persistently raised intracranial pres sure, is important.

### Stroke Medicine Summary

#### **Definition and Epidemiology**
- **Stroke**: Sudden onset of focal cerebral dysfunction due to vascular disease, the third most common cause of disability globally.
- **Types**:
  - **Ischemic (80%)**: Caused by cerebral ischemia (e.g., thrombosis, embolism).
  - **Hemorrhagic (20%)**: Intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
- **Risk Factors**: Hypertension, smoking, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, age, and genetic factors.

#### **Clinical Presentation**
- **Symptoms**: 
  - **Focal neurological deficits**: Hemiparesis, aphasia, visual field loss, ataxia.
  - **Sudden onset** (minutes to hours), often with negative symptoms (loss of function).
- **Stroke Mimics**: Seizures, migraines, brain tumors, metabolic disorders.

#### **Diagnosis**
- **Imaging**:
  - **CT**: Initial test to rule out hemorrhage, detect early ischemic changes.
  - **MRI (DWI)**: More sensitive for acute ischemia, especially in posterior circulation.
  - **Vascular Imaging (CTA/MRA)**: Identifies carotid stenosis, large vessel occlusion.
- **Blood Tests**: Glucose, lipid profile, coagulation studies, inflammatory markers.
- **Cardiac Workup**: ECG, echocardiography (to detect embolic sources like AF).

#### **Acute Management**
- **Ischemic Stroke**:
  - **Thrombolysis (tPA)**: Within 4.5 hours of onset (if no contraindications).
  - **Thrombectomy**: For large vessel occlusion (up to 6 hours, or later with salvageable tissue).
- **Hemorrhagic Stroke**:
  - Blood pressure control, reversal of anticoagulation, surgical evacuation (if indicated).
- **Supportive Care**: Airway management, hydration, glycemic control, prevention of complications (e.g., aspiration, DVT).

#### **Secondary Prevention**
- **Antiplatelets**: Aspirin, clopidogrel (dual therapy for high-risk TIA/minor stroke).
- **Anticoagulation**: For atrial fibrillation (DOACs or warfactin).
- **Risk Factor Modification**:
  - Hypertension control, statins, smoking cessation, diabetes management.
- **Carotid Endarterectomy**: For symptomatic carotid stenosis (70–99%).

#### **Rehabilitation**
- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy.
- **Early mobilization, cognitive and emotional support** to address post-stroke depression and functional recovery.

#### **Subtypes and Special Cases**
- **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)**:
  - **Caused by ruptured aneurysm** (thunderclap headache, meningism).
  - **Management**: Nimodipine (vasospasm prevention), aneurysm coiling/clipping.
- **Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT)**:
  - **Risk factors**: Hypercoagulability, infection, pregnancy.
  - **Treatment**: Anticoagulation (heparin/warfarin).

#### **Prognosis**
- Depends on stroke severity, timeliness of treatment, and rehabilitation.
- **Complications**: Recurrent stroke, disability, cognitive impairment, post-stroke epilepsy.

#### **Key Points**
- **Time-sensitive interventions** (thrombolysis, thrombectomy) are critical.
- **Secondary prevention** reduces recurrence risk.
- **Rehabilitation** is essential for functional recovery and quality of life.
