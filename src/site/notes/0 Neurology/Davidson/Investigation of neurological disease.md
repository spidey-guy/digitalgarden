Experienced clinicians make most neurological diagnoses on history alone, with a lesser contribution from examination and investigation. As investigations become more complex and more easily available, it is tempting to adopt a ‘scan rst, think later’ approach to neurological symptoms. The frequency of ‘false-positive’ results, the wide range of normality and the negative implications for patients (unnecessary expense, inconvenience, discomfort and worry) necessitate a more thoughtful approach. Investigation may include assessment of structure (imaging) and function (neurophysiology). Neurophysiological testing has become so complex that in some countries it constitutes a separate specialty focusing on electroencephalography, evoked potentials, nerve conduction studies and electromyography.

# Neuroimaging
Neurological imaging has traditionally allowed only assessment of structure but advances are allowing much more sophistication.Imaging modalities can use X-rays (plain X-rays, computed tomography (CT), CT angiography, myelography and angiography), magnetic resonance (MR imaging (MRI), MR angiography (MRA)), ultrasound (Doppler imaging of blood vessels) and nuclear medicine techniques (single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET)). The uses and limitations of each of these are shown in Box 28.4. Different sequences for analysing MRI signals can provide helpful information for characterising tissues and pathologies (Box 28.5).
Advanced MR techniques, such as functional MRI (fMRI), MR spectroscopy or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can be used to assess brain metabolism and chemical compositions. This may be dynamic and can provide ‘maps’ of cortical function to help plan lesionectomy and epilepsy surgery. Similarly, MR spectroscopy can outline the chemical composition of specic regions, providing notions of whether lesions are ischaemic, neoplastic or inammatory. Some degenerative neurological conditions cause functional rather
than structural abnormalities that make metabolic and neurochemical assessment increasingly useful. PET scanning can display glucose metabolism in dementia and epilepsy. SPECT scanning uses the lipid-soluble properties of radioactive tracers to mark cerebral blood ow at the time of injection to help in investigating seizures. Dopaminergic pathway tracers can assess the integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway in patients with possible parkinsonism.

## Head and orbit
Plain skull X-rays now have a very limited role in neurological disease. CT or MRI is needed for intracranial imaging. CT is good for demonstrating bone and calcication well. It will also detect abnormalities of the brain and ventricles, such as atrophy, tumours, cysts, abscesses, vascular lesions and hydrocephalus. Diagnostic yield may be improved by the use of intravenous contrast and thinner slicing but CT is not optimal for lesions of meninges, cranial nerves or subtle parenchymal changes. MRI resolution is unaffected by bone and so is more useful in
posterior fossa disease. Its sensitivity for cortical and white matter changes makes it the modality of choice in inflammatory conditions

## Cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine
X-rays are useful for imaging bony structures and can show destruction or damage to vertebrae, for example, but will provide no information about non-bony tissues, such as intervertebral discs, spinal cord and nerve roots. They have some usefulness in dynamic imaging, e.g. exion/ extension of the spine, in the assessment of instability. MRI has transformed spinal investigation, as it can give information not only about vertebrae and intervertebral discs but also about their effects on the spinal cord and nerve roots. Myelography (usually with CT) is a rarely used invasive technique requiring injection of contrast into the lumbar theca. While outlining the nerve roots and spinal cord provides some detail about abnormal structure, the accuracy and availability of MRI have reduced the need for it. Myelography may still be used where MRI is unavailable, contraindicated, or precluded by a patient's claustrophobia. Examples of the cervical spine imaged by plain X-rays, myelography and MRI are shown in Figure 28.13

## Blood vessels
Imaging of the extra- and intracranial blood vessels and disturbance of arterial or venous blood ow is described on page 1214.

# Neurophysiological testing

## Electroencephalography
The electroencephalogram (EEG) detects electrical activity arising in the cerebral cortex via electrodes placed on the scalp to record the amplitude and frequency of the resulting waveforms. With closed eyes, the normal background activity is 8–13 Hz (known as alpha rhythm), most prominent occipitally and suppressed on eye opening. Other frequency bands seen over different parts of the brain in different circumstances are beta (faster than 13/sec), theta (4–8/sec) and delta (slower than 4/sec). Normal EEG patterns evolve with age and alertness; lower frequencies predominate in the very young and during sleep. In recent years digital technology has allowed longer, cleaner EEG
recordings that can be analysed in a number of ways and recorded alongside contemporaneous video of any clinical ‘event’. Meanwhile, the development of intracranial recording allows more sensitive monitoring via surgically placed electrodes in and around lesions to help increase the efcacy and safety of epilepsy surgery. Abnormal EEGs result from a number of conditions. Examples include
an increase in fast frequencies (beta) seen with sedating drugs such as benzodiazepines, or marked focal slowing noted over a structural lesion such as a tumour or an infarct. Improved quality and accessibility of imaging have made EEG redundant in lesion localisation, except in the specialist investigation of epilepsy (p. 1155). EEG remains useful in progressive and continuous disorders such as reduced consciousness, encephalitis, and certain dementias, such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Since sleep induces marked changes in cerebral activity, EEG can be
useful in diagnosis of sleep disturbances. In paroxysmal disorders such as epilepsy, EEG is at its most useful when it captures activity during one of the events in question. Over 50% of patients with epilepsy have a normal ‘routine’ EEG but, conversely, the presence of epileptiform features does not of itself make a diagnosis. Up to 5% of some normal populations may demonstrate epileptiform discharges on EEG, preventing its use as a screening test for epilepsy, most notably in younger patients with a family history of epilepsy. In view of this, the EEG should not be used where epilepsy is merely ‘possible’. Therefore the EEG in epilepsy is predominantly used for classication
and prognostication, but in some patients can help localise the seat of epileptiform discharges when surgery is being considered. During a seizure, high-voltage disturbances of background activity (‘discharges’) are often noted. These may be generalised, as in the 3 Hz ‘spike and wave’ of childhood absence epilepsy, or more focal, as in localisation-related epilepsies (Fig. 28.14). Techniques such as hyperventilation or photic stimulation can be used to increase the yield of epileptiform changes, particularly in the generalised epilepsy syndromes. While some argue that it is possible to detect ‘spikes’ and ‘sharp waves’ to lend support to a clinical diagnosis, these are non-specic and therefore not diagnostic, and can lead an unwary clinician to err in ascribing other symptoms to epilepsy.

## Nerve conduction studies
Electrical stimulation of a nerve causes an impulse to travel both efferently and afferently along the underlying axons. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) make use of this, recording action potentials as they pass along peripheral nerves and (with motor nerves) as they pass into the muscle belly. Digital recording has enhanced sensitivity and reproducibility of these tiny potentials. By measuring the time taken to traverse a known distance, it is possible to calculate nerve conduction velocities (NCVs). Healthy nerves at room temperature will conduct at a speed of 40–50 m/sec. If the recorded potential is smaller than expected, this provides evidence of a reduction in the overall number of functioning axons. Signicant slowing of conduction velocity, in contrast, suggests impaired conduction due to peripheral nerve demyelination. Such changes in NCS may be diffuse (as in a hereditary demyelinating peripheral neuropathy), focal (as in pressure palsies) or multifocal (e.g. Guillain–Barré syndrome, mononeuritis multiplex). The information gained can allow the disease responsible for peripheral nerve dysfunction to be better deduced (see Box 28.86). Stimulation of motor nerves allows for the recording of compound
muscle action potentials (CMAPs) over muscles (Fig. 28.15). These are around 500 times larger than sensory nerve potentials, typically around 1–20 millivolts. Since a proportion of stimulated impulses in motor nerves will ‘reect’ back from the anterior horn cell body (forming the ‘F’ wave), it is also possible to obtain some information about the condition of nerve roots.
Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) at 3–15/sec provides consistent
CMAPs in healthy muscle. In myasthenia gravis (p. 1194), however, where there is partial blockage of acetylcholine receptors, there is a diagnostic fall (decrement) in CMAP amplitude. In contrast, an increasing CMAP with high-frequency RNS is seen in Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (p. 1195).

## Electromyography
Electromyography (EMG) is usually performed alongside NCS and involves needle recording of muscle electrical potential during rest and contraction. At rest, muscle is electrically silent but loss of nerve supply causes muscle membrane to become unstable, manifest as brillations, positive sharp waves (‘spontaneous activity’) or fasciculations. Motor unit action potentials are recorded during muscle contraction. Axonal loss or destruction will result in fewer motor units. Resultant sprouting of remaining units will lead to increasing size of each individual unit on EMG. Myopathy, in contrast, causes muscle bre splitting, which results in a large number of smaller units on EMG. Other abnormal activity, such as myotonic discharges, may signify abnormal ion channel conduction, as in myotonic dystrophy or myotonia congenita. Specialised single-bre electromyography (SFEMG) can be used to investigate neuromuscular junction transmission. Measuring ‘jitter’ and ‘blocking’ can identify the effect of antibodies in reducing the action of acetylcholine on the receptor.

## Evoked potentials
The cortical response to visual, auditory or electrical stimulation can be measured on an EEG as an evoked potential (EP). If a stimulus is provided – e.g. to the eye – the tiny EEG response can be discerned when averaging 100–1000 repeated stimuli. Assessing the latency (the time delay) and amplitude can give information about the integrity of the relevant pathway. MRI now provides more information about CNS pathways, thus reducing reliance on EPs. In practice, visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are most commonly used to help differentiate CNS demyelination from small-vessel white-matter changes (Fig. 28.16).

## Magnetic stimulation
Central conduction times can also be measured using electromagnetic induction of action potentials in the cortex or spinal cord by the local application of specialised coils. Again, MRI has made this technique largely redundant, other than for research.

## Routine blood tests
Many systemic conditions that can affect the nervous system can be identied by simple blood tests. Nutritional deciencies, metabolic disturbances, inammatory conditions or infections may all present or be associated with neurological symptoms, and basic blood tests (full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, biochemical screening) may provide clues. Specic blood tests will be highlighted in the relevant subsections of this chapter. Human immunodeciency virus (HIV) infection is an important cause of neurological disease and the clinician should have a low threshold for checking this.

## Immunological tests
Recent developments have seen a host of new immune-mediated conditions emerge in clinical neurology, with antibody targets ranging from muscle and neuromuscular junction disturbance (causing weakness and muscle pain) to specic neuroglial cell surface molecules such as ion channels (causing cognitive decline, epilepsy and psychiatric changes). Examples of autoantibodies that aid diagnosis and may play a disease-causing role include AChR antibodies (myasthenia gravis), Aquaporin 4 and MOG antibodies (neuromyelitis optica), NMDAR, Lgi1 and CASPR2 antibodies (autoimmune encephalitis). Many of these antibodies to neural/glial cell surface antigens are specically associated with individual neurological syndromes. Many other antibodies against intracellular antigens have also been described, in particular in association with paraneoplastic syndromes, although it is less clear if these antibodies play a causal role in mediating disease.

## Genetic testing
Relevant subsections will detail the increasing numbers of inherited neurological conditions that can now be diagnosed by DNA analysis (p. 52). These include diseases caused by increased numbers of trinucleotide repeats, such as Huntington’s disease myotonic dystrophy; and some types of spinocerebellar ataxia. Mitochondrial DNA can also be sequenced to diagnose relevant disorders. Next-generation sequencing technologies including exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing are increasingly employed to identify undiagnosed genetic disease, but expertise is required in their interpretation (see Ch. 3).

## Lumbar puncture
Lumbar puncture (LP) is the technique used to obtain both a CSF sample and an indirect measure of intracranial pressure. After local anaesthetic injection, a needle is inserted between lumbar spinous processes (usually between L3 and L4) through the dura and into the spinal canal. Intracranial pressure can be deduced (if patients are lying on their side) and CSF removed for analysis. CSF pressure measurement is important in the diagnosis and monitoring of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. In this condition, the LP itself is therapeutic. CSF is normally clear and colourless, and the tests that are usually performed include a naked eye examination of the CSF and centrifugation to determine the colour of the supernatant (yellow, or xanthochromic, some hours after subarachnoid haemorrhage; p. 1214). Measurement of absorption of specic light wavelengths helps quantify the amount of haem metabolites in CSF. Routine analysis involves a cell count, as well as glucose and protein concentrations. CSF assessment is important in investigating infections (meningitis
or encephalitis), subarachnoid haemorrhage and inammatory conditions. Normal values and abnormalities found in specic conditions are shown in Box 28.6. More sophisticated analysis allows measurement of antibody formation solely within the CNS (oligoclonal bands), genetic analysis (e.g. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex or tuberculosis), immunological tests (NMDAR, paraneoplastic antibodies), immunophenotyping by uorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and cytology (to detect malignant cells). If there is a cranial space-occupying lesion causing raised intracranial pressure, LP presents a theoretical risk of downward shift of intracerebral contents, a potentially fatal process known as coning. Consequently, LP is contraindicated if there is any clinical suggestion of raised intracranial pressure (papilloedema), depressed level of consciousness, or focal neurological signs suggesting a cerebral lesion, until imaging (by CT or MRI) has excluded a space-occupying lesion or hydrocephalus. When there is a risk of local haemorrhage (thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation or anticoagulant treatment), then caution should be exercised or specic measures should be taken. LP can be safely performed in patients on low-dose aspirin or low-dose heparin. UK guidelines advise considering pausing other antiplatelet agents for a period before elective LP (e.g. 7 days for clopidogrel). LP may be unsafe in patients who are fully anticoagulated due to the increased risk of epidural haematoma and haematology advice should be sought. About 30% of LPs are followed by a postural headache, due to
reduced CSF pressure. The frequency of headache can be reduced by using smaller or atraumatic needles. Rarer complications involve transient radicular pain, and pain over the lumbar region during the procedure. Aseptic technique renders secondary infections such as meningitis extremely rare.

## Biopsy
Biopsies of nervous tissue (peripheral nerve, muscle, meninges or brain) are occasionally required for diagnosis. Nerve biopsy can help in the investigation of peripheral neuropathy. Usually, a distal sensory nerve (sural or radial) is targeted. Histological examination can help identify underlying causes, such as vasculitides or inltrative disorders like amyloid. Nerve biopsy should not be undertaken lightly since there is an appreciable morbidity; it should be reserved for cases where the diagnosis is in doubt after routine investigations and where it will inuence management. Muscle biopsy is performed more frequently and is indicated for the
differentiation of myositis and myopathies. These conditions can usually be distinguished by histological examination, and enzyme histochemistry can be useful when mitochondrial diseases and storage diseases are suspected. The quadriceps muscle is most commonly biopsied but other muscles may also be sampled if they are involved clinically. Although pain and infection can follow the procedure, these are less of a problem than after nerve biopsy. Imaging and clinical examination may help guide and determine biopsy site. Brain biopsy is required when imaging fails to clarify the nature of
intra cerebral lesions, e.g. in unexplained degenerative diseases such as unusual cases of dementia and in patients with brain tumours. Some biopsies are performed stereotactically through a burr hole in the skull. Nevertheless, haemorrhage, infection and death still occur and brain biopsy should be considered only if a diagnosis is otherwise elusive. Discussion between neurologist, neuroradiologist, neurosurgeon and neuropathologist is important to ensure maximal diagnostic yield of these samples.
Biopsy of other organs can be useful in the diagnosis of systemic
disorders presenting as neurological problems, such as tonsillar biopsy (prion diseases), or rectal or fat biopsy (for assessment of amyloid).

# Summary

## GLM 4

The provided text, "activeNote," is a comprehensive overview of neurological investigations, covering both imaging and neurophysiological testing. Here's a summary of its key points:

**Investigation Approach:**

*   Experienced clinicians rely heavily on patient history for diagnosis, with imaging and other tests playing a supporting role.
*   A "scan first, think later" approach is discouraged due to the potential for false positives, wide normal ranges, and unnecessary patient stress and expense.
*   Investigations should be thoughtful and targeted, considering the specific neurological symptoms and suspected conditions.

**Neuroimaging:**

*   Various imaging modalities exist, including X-ray/CT, MRI, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine techniques (SPECT, PET).
*   Each modality has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the specific clinical question.
*   CT is good for bone and calcification, while MRI excels in soft tissue imaging, particularly in the posterior fossa and temporal lobes.
*   Advanced MRI techniques (fMRI, spectroscopy, DTI) provide functional and metabolic information, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning.
*   Ultrasound is useful for Doppler imaging of blood vessels but has limitations in anatomical detail.
*   Nuclear medicine techniques (SPECT, PET) are valuable for assessing brain function and metabolism but are less widely available and more expensive.

**Imaging Applications:**

*   **Head and Orbit:** MRI is preferred for most intracranial imaging due to its superior soft tissue resolution. CT is useful for bone and calcification assessment.
*   **Spine:** MRI has revolutionized spinal imaging, providing detailed information about vertebrae, discs, spinal cord, and nerve roots. Myelography is rarely used now.
*   **Blood Vessels:** Various techniques are available to image blood vessels and assess blood flow disturbances.

**Neurophysiological Testing:**

*   **Electroencephalography (EEG):** Records electrical activity in the brain, useful for diagnosing epilepsy, sleep disorders, and certain types of dementia. However, it has limitations in localizing structural lesions.
*   **Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS):** Measures the speed and strength of electrical signals in peripheral nerves, helping diagnose conditions like peripheral neuropathy and myasthenia gravis.
*   **Electromyography (EMG):** Records muscle electrical activity, useful for diagnosing muscle and nerve disorders.
*   **Evoked Potentials (EPs):** Measures the brain's response to sensory stimuli, helpful in assessing the integrity of specific neural pathways.
*   **Magnetic Stimulation:** Used to measure central conduction times, but largely replaced by MRI.

**Other Investigations:**

*   **Blood Tests:** Can identify systemic conditions affecting the nervous system, such as infections, metabolic disorders, and nutritional deficiencies.
*   **Immunological Tests:** Detect antibodies associated with autoimmune neurological disorders.
*   **Genetic Testing:** Identifies inherited neurological conditions through DNA analysis.
*   **Lumbar Puncture (LP):** Obtains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis, helping diagnose infections, inflammation, and other neurological conditions. However, it carries risks and should be performed cautiously.
*   **Biopsy:** Involves taking a small sample of nervous tissue or other organs for microscopic examination, helping diagnose certain neurological conditions. However, it is invasive and should be reserved for specific cases.

**Overall Message:**

Neurological investigations should be approached thoughtfully and selectively, considering the patient's history, symptoms, and suspected conditions. A combination of imaging, neurophysiological testing, and other investigations can provide valuable information for diagnosis and treatment planning.
