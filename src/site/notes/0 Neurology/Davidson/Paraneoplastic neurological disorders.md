Neurological disease may occur with systemic malignant tumours in the absence of cerebral metastases. It is now recognised that, in the majority of these cases, antigen production in the body of the tumour leads to development of antibodies to parts of the CNS. Paraneoplastic conditions are increasingly recognised and the number of antibodies identied is also growing (Box 28.50). These syndromes are particularly associated with small-cell carcinoma of lung, ovarian tumours and lymphomas. Autoantibodies are found in the serum and/or CSF, and biopsy will show a lymphocytic inltrate of the neural tissue affected

# Clinical features
Clinical presentations are summarised in Box 28.50. In most instances, the neurological condition progresses quite rapidly over a few months, preceding the malignant disease in around half of cases. The range of clinical patterns is so wide that paraneoplastic disease should be considered in the diagnosis of any unusual progressive neurological syndrome. The paraneoplastic disorders of the peripheral nervous system particularly affect the synaptic cleft (p. 1122).

# Investigations and management 
The presence of characteristic autoantibodies in the context of a suspicious clinical picture may be diagnostic. The causative tumour may be very small and therefore CT of the chest or abdomen or PET scanning may be necessary to nd it. These investigations should be pursued only when paraneoplastic disease has been proven, rather than when it is suspected. The CSF often shows an increased protein and lymphocyte count with oligoclonal bands. Treatment is directed at the primary tumour. Occasionally, successful
therapy of the tumour is associated with improvement of the paraneoplastic syndrome. Some improvement may occur following administration of intravenous immunoglobulin.
