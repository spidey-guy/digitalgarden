The spinal cord and spinal roots may be affected by intrinsic disease or by disorders of the surrounding meninges and bones. The clinical presentation of these conditions depends on the anatomical level at which the cord or roots are affected, as well as the nature of the pathological process involved. It is important to recognise when the spinal cord is at risk of compression so that urgent action can be taken.

# Cervical spondylosis
Cervical spondylosis is the result of osteoarthritis in the cervical spine. It is characterised by degeneration of the intervertebral discs and osteophyte formation. Such ‘wear and tear’ is extremely common and radiological changes are frequently found in asymptomatic individuals over the age of 50. Spondylosis may be associated with neurological dysfunction. In order of frequency, the C5/6, C6/7 and C4/5 vertebral levels affect C6, C7 and C5 roots, respectively (Fig. 28.44).

## Cervical radiculopathy
Acute onset of compression of a nerve root occurs when a disc prolapses laterally. More gradual onset may be due to osteophytic encroachment of the intervertebral foramina.

### Clinical features
The patient complains of pain in the neck that may radiate in the distribution of the affected nerve root. The neck is held rigidly and neck movements may exacerbate pain. Paraesthesia and sensory loss may be found in the affected segment and there may be lower motor neuron signs, including weakness, wasting and reex impairment (Fig. 28.45).
#### [[0 Neurology/Davidson/Attachments/Davidson Neurology 6.jpg|Fig. 28.45 Findings in cervical nerve root compression.]]
### Investigations 
Where there is no trauma, imaging should not be carried out for isolated cervical pain. MRI is the investigation of choice in those with radicular symptoms. X-rays offer limited benet, except in excluding destructive lesions, and electrophysiological studies rarely add to clinical examination with MRI.
### Management 
Conservative treatment with analgesics and physiotherapy results in resolution of symptoms in the great majority of patients, but a few require surgery in the form of discectomy or radicular decompression.

## Cervical myelopathy 
Dorsomedial herniation of a disc and the development of transverse bony bars or posterior osteophytes may result in pressure on the spinal cord or the anterior spinal artery, which supplies the anterior two-thirds of the cord (see Fig. 28.44).

### Clinical features
The onset is usually insidious and painless but acute deterioration may occur after trauma, especially hyperextension injury. Upper motor neuron signs develop in the limbs, with spasticity of the legs usually appearing before the arms are involved. Sensory loss in the upper limbs is common, producing tingling, numbness and proprioception loss in the hands, with progressive clumsiness. Sensory manifestations in the legs are much less common. Neurological decit usually progresses gradually and disturbance of micturition is a very late feature.

### Investigations 
MRI (see Fig. 28.44) (or rarely myelography) will direct surgical intervention. The former provides information on the state of the spinal cord at the level of compression.

### Management 
Surgical procedures, including laminectomy and anterior discectomy, may arrest progression of disability but neurological improvement is not the rule. The decision as to whether surgery should be undertaken may be difcult. Manual manipulation of the cervical spine is of no proven benet and may precipitate acute neurological deterioration

### Prognosis 
The prognosis of cervical myelopathy is variable. In many patients, the condition stabilises or even improves without intervention. If progression results in sphincter dysfunction or pyramidal signs, surgical decompression should be considered.

# Lumbar spondylosis
This term covers degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritic change in the lumbar spine. Pain in the distribution of the lumbar or sacral roots (‘sciatica’) is almost always due to disc protrusion but can be a feature of other rare but important disorders, including spinal tumour, malignant disease in the pelvis and tuberculosis of the vertebral bodies.

## Lumbar disc herniation
While acute lumbar disc herniation is often precipitated by trauma (usually lifting heavy weights while the spine is exed), genetic factors may also be important. The nucleus pulposus may bulge or rupture through the annulus brosus, giving rise to pressure on nerve endings in the spinal ligaments, changes in the vertebral joints or pressure on nerve roots.

### Pathophysiology 
The altered mechanics of the lumbar spine result in loss of lumbar lordosis and there may be spasm of the paraspinal musculature. Root pressure is suggested by limitation of exion of the hip on the affected side if the straight leg is raised (Lasègue sign). If the third or fourth lumbar root is involved, Lasègue sign may be negative, but pain in the back may be induced by hyperextension of the hip (femoral nerve stretch test). The roots most frequently affected are S1, L5 and L4; the signs of root pressure at these levels are summarised in Figure 28.46
#### [[0 Neurology/Davidson/Attachments/Davidson Neurology 7.jpg|Fig. 28.46 Findings in lumbar nerve root compression]]

### Clinical features
The onset may be sudden or gradual. Alternatively, repeated episodes of low back pain may precede sciatica by months or years. Constant aching pain is felt in the lumbar region and may radiate to the buttock, thigh, calf and foot. Pain is exacerbated by coughing or straining but may be relieved by lying at.
### Investigations 
MRI is the investigation of choice if available, since soft tissues are well imaged. Plain X-rays of the lumbar spine are of little value in the diagnosis of disc disease, although they may demonstrate conditions affecting the vertebral body. CT can provide helpful images of the disc protrusion and/ or narrowing of exit foramina.
### Management 
Some 90% of patients with sciatica recover following conservative treatment with analgesia and early mobilisation; bed rest does not help recovery. The patient should be instructed in back-strengthening exercises and advised to avoid physical manoeuvres likely to strain the lumbar spine. Injections of local anaesthetic or glucocorticoids may be useful adjunctive treatment if symptoms are due to ligamentous injury or joint dysfunction. Surgery may have to be considered if there is no response to conservative treatment or if progressive neurological decits develop. Central disc prolapse with bilateral symptoms and signs and disturbance of sphincter function requires urgent surgical decompression.

## Lumbar canal stenosis
This occurs with a congenitally narrowed lumbar spinal canal, exacerbated by the degenerative changes that commonly occur with age.
### Pathophysiology 
The symptoms of spinal stenosis are thought to be due to local vascular compromise secondary to the canal stenosis, rendering the nerve roots ischaemic and intolerant of the increased demand that occurs on exercise.
### Clinical features
Patients, who are usually in old age, develop exercise-induced weakness and paraesthesia in the legs (‘spinal claudication’). These symptoms progress with continued exertion, often to the point that the patient can no longer walk, but are quickly relieved by a short period of rest. Physical examination at rest shows preservation of peripheral pulses with absent ankle reexes. Weakness or sensory loss may only be apparent if the patient is examined immediately after exercise.
### Investigations 
The investigation of rst choice is MRI, but contraindications (body habitus, metallic implants) may make CT or myelography necessary
### Management 
Lumbar laminectomy may provide relief of symptoms and recovery of normal exercise tolerance.

# Spinal cord compression
Spinal cord compression is one of the more common neurological emergencies encountered in clinical practice and the usual causes are listed in Box 28.78. A space-occupying lesion within the spinal canal may damage nerve tissue either directly by pressure or indirectly by interference with blood supply. Oedema from venous obstruction impairs neuronal function, and ischaemia from arterial obstruction may lead to necrosis of the spinal cord. The early stages of damage are reversible but severely damaged neurons do not recover; hence the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.

## Clinical features 
The onset of symptoms of spinal cord compression is usually slow (over
weeks) but can be acute as a result of trauma or metastases (see Figs. 28.44, 28.47 and 28.48), especially if there is associated arterial occlusion. The symptoms are shown in Box 28.79 Pain and sensory symptoms occur early, while weakness and sphincter dysfunction are usually late manifestations. The signs vary according to the level of the cord compression and the structures involved. There may be tenderness to percussion over the spine if there is vertebral disease and this may be associated with a local kyphosis. Involvement of the roots at the level of the compression may cause dermatomal sensory impairment and corresponding lower motor signs. Interruption of bres in the spinal cord causes sensory loss and upper motor neuron signs below the level of the lesion, and there is often disturbance of sphincter function. The distribution of these signs varies with the level of the lesion (Box 28.80). The Brown–Séquard syndrome (see Fig. 28.18E) results if damage is conned to one side of the cord; the ndings are explained by the anatomy of the sensory tracts (see Fig. 28.11). With compressive lesions, there is usually a band of pain at the level of the lesion in the distribution of the nerve roots subject to compression.

## Investigations 
Patients with a history of acute or subacute spinal cord syndrome should be investigated urgently, as listed in Box 28.81. The investigation of choice is MRI (Fig. 28.47), as it can dene the extent of compression and associated soft-tissue abnormality (Fig. 28.48). Plain X-rays may show bony destruction and soft-tissue abnormalities. Routine investigations, including chest X-ray, may provide evidence of systemic disease. If myelography is performed, CSF should be taken for analysis; in cases of complete spinal block, this shows a normal cell count with a very elevated protein causing yellow discoloration of the uid (Froin syndrome). The risk of acute deterioration after myelography in spinal cord compression means that the neurosurgeons should be alerted before it is undertaken. Where a secondary tumour is causing the compression, needle biopsy may be required to establish a tissue diagnosis.

## Management 
Treatment and prognosis depend on the nature of the underlying lesion. Benign tumours should be surgically excised, and a good functional recovery can be expected unless a marked neurological decit has developed before diagnosis. Extradural compression due to malignancy is the most common cause of spinal cord compression in developed countries and has a poor prognosis. Useful function can be regained if treatment, such as radiotherapy, is initiated within 24 hours of the onset of severe weakness or sphincter dysfunction; management should involve close cooperation with both oncologists and neurosurgeons (p. 139). Spinal cord compression due to tuberculosis is common in some areas of the world and may require surgical treatment. This should be followed by appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy for an extended period. Traumatic lesions of the vertebral column require specialised neurosurgical treatment.

# Intrinsic diseases of the spinal cord
There are many disorders that interfere with spinal cord function due to non-compressive involvement of the spinal cord itself. A list of these disorders is given in Box 28.82. The symptoms and signs are generally similar to those that would occur with extrinsic compression (see Boxes 28.79 and 28.80), although a suspended sensory loss (see Fig. 28.18F) can occur only with intrinsic disease such as syringomyelia. Urinary symptoms usually occur earlier in the course of an intrinsic cord disorder than with compressive disorders. Investigation of intrinsic disease starts with imaging to exclude a
compressive lesion. MRI provides most information about structural lesions, such as diastematomyelia, syringomyelia (Fig. 28.49) or intrinsic tumours. Non-specic signal change may be seen in the spinal cord in inammatory (see Fig. 28.28) or infective conditions and metabolic disorders such as vitamin B12
deciency. Lumbar puncture or blood tests may be required to make a specic diagnosis.

# Summary

## Deepseek V3
### **Disorders of the Spine and Spinal Cord: Summary**

The spine and spinal cord can be affected by intrinsic diseases or external compression from surrounding structures. Key conditions include:

### **1. Cervical Spondylosis**  
- Degenerative changes in the cervical spine (osteophytes, disc degeneration).  
- Can lead to **cervical radiculopathy** (nerve root compression) or **cervical myelopathy** (spinal cord compression).  
- Symptoms: Neck pain, radicular pain, weakness, sensory loss, and, in myelopathy, spasticity and gait disturbances.  
- **Management:** Conservative (analgesics, physiotherapy) or surgical decompression if severe.  

### **2. Cervical Radiculopathy**  
- Acute (disc herniation) or chronic (osteophytes) nerve root compression.  
- **Symptoms:** Pain, sensory loss, weakness in the affected nerve root distribution.  
- **Diagnosis:** MRI (gold standard).  
- **Treatment:** Mostly conservative; surgery for severe or progressive cases.  

### **3. Cervical Myelopathy**  
- Spinal cord compression (e.g., disc herniation, osteophytes).  
- **Symptoms:** Spasticity, weakness, hand clumsiness, sensory loss.  
- **Diagnosis:** MRI.  
- **Treatment:** Surgical decompression if progressive.  

### **4. Lumbar Spondylosis & Disc Herniation**  
- Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.  
- **Lumbar radiculopathy (sciatica):**  
  - **Symptoms:** Low back pain radiating to the leg.  
  - **Management:** Conservative (analgesics, physiotherapy); surgery for severe cases.  
- **Lumbar canal stenosis:**  
  - **Symptoms:** Neurogenic claudication (leg pain with walking, relieved by rest).  
  - **Treatment:** Surgical decompression if severe.  

### **5. Spinal Cord Compression (Emergency!)**  
- **Causes:**  
  - **Vertebral (80%):** Trauma, disc herniation, metastases.  
  - **Meningeal (15%):** Tumors (e.g., meningioma, neurofibroma).  
  - **Intramedullary (5%):** Spinal cord tumors (e.g., glioma).  
- **Symptoms:**  
  - Pain, sensory loss, weakness, sphincter dysfunction.  
  - **Cervical:** Quadriparesis.  
  - **Thoracic:** Paraparesis.  
  - **Cauda equina:** Lower motor neuron signs.  
- **Diagnosis:** **MRI (urgent).**  
- **Management:**  
  - **Surgical decompression** (e.g., laminectomy).  
  - **Radiotherapy/chemotherapy** for metastatic disease.  

### **6. Intrinsic Spinal Cord Diseases (Non-Compressive)**  
- **Causes:**  
  - **Inflammatory (e.g., transverse myelitis, MS).**  
  - **Vascular (spinal stroke).**  
  - **Metabolic (B12 deficiency).**  
  - **Degenerative (motor neuron disease).**  
- **Diagnosis:** MRI, CSF analysis, blood tests.  

### **Key Takeaways:**  
- **Spinal cord compression is a medical emergency (urgent MRI needed).**  
- **Cervical myelopathy and cauda equina syndrome require prompt intervention.**  
- **Most degenerative spine conditions are managed conservatively.**  
- **Intrinsic spinal cord diseases (e.g., MS, B12 deficiency) need specific treatments.**

**Summary of Disorders of the Spine and Spinal Cord**

1. **Cervical Spondylosis**
   - **Definition**: Osteoarthritis in the cervical spine, characterized by disc degeneration and osteophyte formation.
   - **Clinical Features**: Common in asymptomatic individuals over 50. May cause neurological dysfunction, typically affecting C5/6, C6/7, and C4/5 levels.
   - **Investigations**: MRI is the gold standard for diagnosing radicular symptoms.
   - **Management**: Conservative treatment (analgesics, physiotherapy) is effective in most cases. Surgery may be required for severe cases.

2. **Cervical Radiculopathy**
   - **Definition**: Compression of a cervical nerve root due to disc prolapse or osteophytic encroachment.
   - **Clinical Features**: Neck pain radiating to the affected nerve root distribution, with possible paraesthesia, sensory loss, and lower motor neuron signs.
   - **Investigations**: MRI is preferred for diagnosis.
   - **Management**: Conservative treatment usually resolves symptoms. Surgery may be necessary for persistent cases.

3. **Cervical Myelopathy**
   - **Definition**: Compression of the spinal cord due to disc herniation, osteophytes, or trauma.
   - **Clinical Features**: Insidious onset of upper motor neuron signs, sensory loss, and progressive clumsiness. Acute deterioration may occur after trauma.
   - **Investigations**: MRI or myelography to assess cord compression.
   - **Management**: Surgical decompression may arrest progression, but neurological improvement is not guaranteed.

4. **Lumbar Spondylosis**
   - **Definition**: Degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritic changes in the lumbar spine.
   - **Clinical Features**: Low back pain, sciatica, and possible neurological deficits.
   - **Investigations**: MRI is the investigation of choice.
   - **Management**: Conservative treatment (analgesia, mobilisation) is effective in most cases. Surgery may be required for severe or progressive cases.

5. **Lumbar Disc Herniation**
   - **Definition**: Prolapse of the intervertebral disc, causing nerve root compression.
   - **Clinical Features**: Acute or gradual onset of low back pain, sciatica, and neurological deficits.
   - **Investigations**: MRI or CT to assess disc protrusion.
   - **Management**: Conservative treatment is effective in most cases. Surgery may be necessary for severe or progressive cases.

6. **Lumbar Canal Stenosis**
   - **Definition**: Narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal, exacerbated by degenerative changes.
   - **Clinical Features**: Exercise-induced weakness and paraesthesia in the legs (spinal claudication).
   - **Investigations**: MRI is the investigation of choice.
   - **Management**: Lumbar laminectomy may provide relief.

7. **Spinal Cord Compression**
   - **Definition**: Compression of the spinal cord due to various causes (e.g., trauma, tumours, infections).
   - **Clinical Features**: Pain, sensory loss, motor weakness, and sphincter dysfunction. Symptoms may progress rapidly.
   - **Investigations**: Urgent MRI or myelography to assess compression.
   - **Management**: Early surgical decompression or radiotherapy may improve outcomes.

8. **Intrinsic Diseases of the Spinal Cord**
   - **Definition**: Disorders affecting the spinal cord itself, including congenital, infective, inflammatory, vascular, neoplastic, metabolic, and degenerative conditions.
   - **Clinical Features**: Variable symptoms and signs, often similar to compressive lesions, but may include suspended sensory loss or early urinary symptoms.
   - **Investigations**: MRI, lumbar puncture, and blood tests to diagnose underlying conditions.
   - **Management**: Treatment depends on the underlying cause, ranging from medical therapy to surgery.

This note covers disorders of the spine and spinal cord, including cervical and lumbar spondylosis, spinal cord compression, and intrinsic spinal cord diseases.

**Cervical Spondylosis:**  Osteoarthritis of the cervical spine leading to degeneration and osteophyte formation. Can cause cervical radiculopathy (nerve root compression) with pain, sensory loss, and motor deficits, or cervical myelopathy (spinal cord compression) with upper motor neuron signs, sensory loss, and potential sphincter dysfunction.  MRI is key for diagnosis. Treatment ranges from conservative management to surgery.

**Lumbar Spondylosis:** Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, often leading to lumbar disc herniation.  Lumbar disc herniation causes sciatica (pain in the distribution of lumbar/sacral roots).  MRI is the preferred investigation.  Management is usually conservative, but surgery may be needed. Lumbar canal stenosis, often in older patients, causes spinal claudication (exercise-induced leg weakness and paresthesia relieved by rest). MRI is used for diagnosis, and laminectomy may provide relief.

**Spinal Cord Compression:** A neurological emergency caused by space-occupying lesions (e.g., trauma, tumors, disc prolapse) that damage the spinal cord. Symptoms include pain, sensory changes, motor weakness, and sphincter dysfunction.  MRI is crucial for diagnosis. Treatment depends on the cause, ranging from surgery for benign tumors to radiotherapy for malignancy. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical.

**Intrinsic Diseases of the Spinal Cord:** Disorders affecting the spinal cord itself (e.g., transverse myelitis, vascular issues, tumors, metabolic deficiencies, syringomyelia). Symptoms are similar to extrinsic compression, but suspended sensory loss is specific to intrinsic disease. MRI is essential to exclude compression, and further investigations (lumbar puncture, blood tests) are needed for specific diagnoses. The table lists various intrinsic diseases, their causes, and clinical features.
