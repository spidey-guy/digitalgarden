Many patients present with functional symptoms and some may have a functional neurological disorder (FND). FND (also known as functional neurological symptom disorder, dissociative neurological symptom disorder, or conversion disorder) is a disorder at the interface of neurology and psychiatry, reecting function or dysfunction in the shared organ, the brain. The symptoms are involuntary and cause considerable disability. Core to the assessment and management of most patients is a diagnosis made on positive grounds, communicated to patients in a manner that contributes constructively to management. Functional symptoms are not consistent with any other recognised
neurological disease or disorder. The diagnosis depends on demonstrating internal inconsistency. The inconsistency will depend on the specic functional symptom. Functional symptoms include functional weakness, sensory disturbance, pain, movement disorders, dissociative attacks (also called non-epileptic attacks), visual symptoms, speech and cognitive symptoms. Examples of internal inconsistency include: weakness of hip extension when the patient tries to extend the hip, which is overcome when the opposite hip is exed against resistance (Hoover’s sign); marked weakness of the legs on examination in a patient able to stand and walk; a detailed description of specic events of memory loss; and expressive dysphasia with retained written language. Other ndings may include: non-anatomical sensory loss, abnormal movements that are distractable, and dissociative or non-epileptic attacks occurring in the absence of concomitant EEG abnormality. Tiredness, poor concentration and sleep disturbance are also common.
Many but not all patients with FND have predisposing and perpetuating factors (Box 28.25) that may include anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, a history of abuse or aversive events. There may be a precipitating event, which may at times appear minor in comparison to the range and severity of the patient’s symptoms. 
The approach to the patient with FND or functional symptoms should ideally include:
	 a detailed history exploring all symptoms 
	 examination looking for positive ndings, e.g. Hoover’s sign 
	 review of past medical records, which often contain functional symptoms in other organ systems, e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, globus, non-cardiac chest pain
	 rapid investigation to exclude a structural cause 
	 and a clear, constructive explanation of the diagnosis based on positive ndings rather than the rather unhelpful ‘medically unexplained symptom’ approach of the past.
There are several useful websites that provide patients with additional information and advice (p. XXX). For many patients understanding their symptoms and the condition will be sufcient, others may require additional multidisciplinary support and treatment from a range of professionals including: physiotherapy, occupational and speech therapy, neurology and neuropsychiatry/psychiatry. Treatment may include neurophysiotherapy, use of antidepressant medication (although not all patients are depressed) and cognitive behavioural therapy. The diagnosis should not be made simply because the patient’s presentation is unusual. A diagnosis of FND should be based on an appropriate history, examination and normal relevant ndings on investigation. Factitious disorders and malingering are not the same as FND. In
the absence of clear objective evidence, e.g. witnessing a patient tampering with tests, diagnosis of these disorders should best be left to psychiatrists
