Sleep disturbances include too much sleep (hypersomnolence or excessive daytime sleepiness), insufcient or poor-quality sleep (insomnia) and abnormal behaviour during sleep (parasomnias). Insomnia is usually caused by psychological or psychiatric disorders, shift work and other environmental causes, pain and so on, and will not be discussed further. Many symptoms and disorders may affect sleep and sleep quality (e.g. pain, depression/anxiety, parkinsonism).

# Excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnolence)
There are primary and secondary causes (Box 28.42). The most common causes are impaired sleep due to lifestyle issues or sleep-disordered breathing. Sleepiness may be measured using the Epworth sleepiness scale (see Box 17.86). Most causes will be identied by a detailed history from the patient and their bed partner, and a 2-week sleep diary.

## Narcolepsy
This has a prevalence of about 1 in 2000, with peak onset in adolescence and early middle age. The key symptom is sudden, irresistible ‘sleep attacks’, often in inappropriate circumstances such as while eating or talking. Other characteristic features help distinguish this from excessive daytime sleepiness (Box 28.43). Symptoms may be due to loss of hypocretin-secreting hypothalamic neurons. Diagnosis requires sleep study with sleep latency testing (demonstrating rapid onset of REM sleep). Narcolepsy may respond to stimulants such as modanil but more severe cases may require sodium oxybate, dexamfetamine, methylphenidate or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Cataplexy can be debilitating and can respond to sodium oxybate or to antidepressants, such as clomipramine or venlafaxine.

 # Parasomnias
 Parasomnias are abnormal motor behaviours that occur around sleep. They may arise in either REM or non-REM sleep, with characteristic features and timing. Non-REM parasomnias tend to occur early in sleep. Parasomnias should be distinguished from other motor disturbances (such as periodic limb movements, hypnic jerks or sleep talking) and sleep-onset epileptic seizures. History from a sleeping partner or other witness is essential.

## Non-REM parasomnias
These are due to incomplete arousal from non-REM sleep and manifest as night terrors, sleep walking and confusional arousals (sleep drunkenness). They typically occur within an hour or two of sleep onset, are common in children and usually of no pathological signicance. Rarely, they persist into adulthood and may become increasingly complex, including dressing, moving objects, eating, drinking or even acts of violence. Patients have little or no recollection of the episodes, even though they appear ‘awake’. The episodes may be triggered by alcohol or unfamiliar sleeping situations and can be familial. Treatment is usually not required but clonazepam can be used.

## REM sleep behaviour disorder
In REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), patients ‘act out’ their dreams during REM sleep, due to failure of the usual muscle atonia. Sleep partners provide typical histories of patients ‘ghting’ or ‘struggling’ in their sleep, sometimes causing injury to themselves or to their partner. They are easily roused from this state, with recollection of their dream, unlike in non-REM states. RBD is more common in men and may be an early symptom of neurodegenerative diseases such as alpha synucleinopathies, perhaps preceding more typical symptoms of these conditions by years. Polysomnography will conrm absence of atonia during REM sleep. Clonazepam is the most successful treatment.

## Restless legs syndrome
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is common, with a prevalence of up to 10%, but many patients never seek medical attention. It is characterised by unpleasant leg (rarely, arm) sensations that are eased by movement (motor restlessness); the diagnosis is clinical (Box 28.44). It has a strong familial tendency and can present with daytime somnolence due to poor sleep. It is usually idiopathic but may be associated with iron deciency, pregnancy, peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson’s disease or uraemia. It should be distinguished from akathisia, the daytime motor restlessness that is an adverse effect of antipsychotic drugs. Treatment, if required, is with gabapentanoids, dopaminergic drugs (dopamine agonists or levodopa) or benzodiazepines. Serum ferritin should be maintained above 75 µg/L.

### 28.44 Diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome 
A need to move the legs, usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable,
unpleasant sensations in the legs, with the following features: 
	 only present or worse during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting 
	 partially or totally relieved by movement such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues
	 generally worse or occurs only in the evening or night.

## Periodic limb movements in sleep
Unlike RLS, periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) only occur during sleep and cause repetitive exion movements of the limbs, usually in the early (non-REM) stages of sleep. Although patients are unaware of the symptoms, they may disrupt sleep quality and often disturb partners. The pathological signicance of PLMS is uncertain and it often occurs in normal health. There is an overlap with RLS. Treatment is most successful with clonazepam or dopaminergic drugs.
