Disorders of the peripheral nervous system are common and may affect the motor, sensory or autonomic components, either in isolation or in combination. The site of pathology may be nerve root (radiculopathy), nerve plexus (plexopathy) or nerve (neuropathy). Neuropathies may present as mononeuropathy (single nerve affected), multiple mononeuropathies (‘mononeuritis multiplex’) or a symmetrical polyneuropathy (Box 28.83). Cranial nerves 3–12 share the same tissue characteristics as peripheral nerves elsewhere and are subject to the same range of diseases.

# Pathophysiology
Damage may occur to the nerve cell body (axon) or the myelin sheath (Schwann cell), leading to axonal or demyelinating neuropathies. The distinction is important, as only demyelinating neuropathies are usually susceptible to treatment. Making the distinction requires neurophysiology (nerve conduction studies and EMG). Neuropathies can occur in association with many systemic diseases, toxins and drugs (Box 28.84).

# Clinical features
Motor nerve involvement produces features of a lower motor neuron lesion. Symptoms and signs of sensory nerve involvement depend on the type of sensory nerve involved; small-bre neuropathies are often painful. Autonomic involvement may cause postural hypotension, disturbance of sweating, cardiac rhythm and gastrointestinal, bladder and sexual functions; isolated autonomic neuropathies are rare and more commonly complicate other neuropathies.
# Investigations 
The investigations required reect the wide spectrum of causes (Box 28.85). Neurophysiological tests are key in discriminating between demyelinating and axonal neuropathies, and in identifying entrapment neuropathies. Most neuropathies are of the chronic axonal type.

# Entrapment neuropathy
Focal compression or entrapment is the usual cause of a mononeuropathy. Symptoms and signs of entrapment neuropathy are listed in Box 28.86. Entrapment neuropathies may affect anyone, but diabetes,excess alcohol or toxins, or genetic syndromes may be predisposing causes. Unless axonal loss has occurred, entrapment neuropathies will recover, provided the primary cause is removed, either by avoiding the precipitation of activity or by surgical decompression.

# Multifocal neuropathy
Multifocal neuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex) is characterised by lesions of multiple nerve roots, peripheral nerves or cranial nerves (Box 28.87). Vasculitis is a common cause, either as part of a systemic disease or isolated to the nerves, or it may arise on a background of a polyneuropathy (e.g. diabetes). Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with conduction block is a rare pure motor neuropathy, typically affecting the arms; it is associated with anti-GM1 antibodies in about 50% and responds to intravenous immunoglobulin.

# Polyneuropathy
A polyneuropathy is typically associated with a ‘length-dependent’ pattern, occurring in the longest peripheral nerves rst and affecting the distal lower limbs before the upper limbs. Sensory symptoms and signs develop in an ascending ‘glove and stocking’ distribution. In inammatory demyelinating neuropathies, the pathology may be more patchy, affecting the upper rather than lower limbs.
# Guillain–Barré syndrome
Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is a heterogeneous group of immunemediated conditions of acute peripheral nerve inammation, with an incidence of 1–2/100 000/year. In Europe and North America, the most common variant is an acute inammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). Axonal variants, either motor (acute motor axonal neuropathy, AMAN) or sensorimotor, are more common in China and Japan, and account for 10% of GBS in Western countries, often associated with Campylobacter jejuni. The hallmark is an acute paralysis evolving over days or weeks, with loss of tendon reexes. About two-thirds of those with AIDP have a prior history of infection, and an autoimmune response triggered by the preceding infection is thought to cause peripheral nerve inammation. A number of GBS variants have been described, associated with specic anti-ganglioside antibodies; the best recognised is Miller Fisher syndrome, which involves anti-GQ1b antibodies.
## Clinical features
Distal paraesthesia and pain precede muscle weakness that ascends rapidly from lower to upper limbs and is more marked proximally than distally. Facial and bulbar weakness commonly develops, and respiratory weakness requiring ventilatory support occurs in 20% of cases. Weakness progresses over a maximum of 4 weeks (usually less). Rapid deterioration to respiratory failure can develop within hours. Examination shows diffuse weakness with loss of reexes. Miller Fisher syndrome presents with internal and external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areexia.
## Investigations 
The CSF protein is raised, but may be normal in the rst 10 days. There is usually no increase in CSF white cell count (> 50 ×106 cells/L suggests an alternative diagnosis; though the cell count may be considerably higher in HIV infection). Electrophysiological changes may emerge after a week or so, with conduction block and multifocal motor slowing, sometimes most evident proximally as delayed F waves. Antibodies to the ganglioside GM1 are found in about 25%, usually the motor axonal form. Other causes of an acute neuromuscular paralysis should be considered (e.g. poliomyelitis, botulism, acute intermittent porphyria, diphtheria, spinal cord syndromes or myasthenia), via the history and examination. Nerve roots are an important site of inammation and contrast uptake is sometimes seen here in contrast-enhanced MRI spinal cord imaging.
## Management 
Active treatment with plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy shortens the duration of ventilation and improves prognosis. In severe GBS, both intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange started within 2 weeks of onset hasten recovery, with similar rates of adverse effects but IVIg treatment is signicantly more likely to be completed than plasma exchange. The choice of treatment often depends on logistical considerations. Overall, 80% of patients recover completely within 3–6 months, 4% die and the remainder suffer residual neurological disability, which can be severe. Adverse prognostic features include older age, rapid deterioration to ventilation and evidence of axonal loss on EMG. Supportive measures to prevent pressure sores and deep venous thrombosis are essential. Regular monitoring of respiratory function (vital capacity) is needed in the acute phase, as respiratory failure may develop with little warning.
# Chronic polyneuropathy
The most common axonal and demyelinating causes of polyneuropathy are shown in Box 28.84. A chronic symmetrical axonal polyneuropathy, evolving over months or years, is the most common form of chronic neuropathy. Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause but in about 25%–50% no cause can be found.
## Hereditary neuropathy
Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is an umbrella term for the inherited neuropathies. The members of this group of syndromes have different clinical and genetic features. The most common CMT is the autosomal dominantly inherited CMT type 1, usually caused by a duplication in the PMP-22 gene. Common signs are distal wasting (‘inverted champagne bottle’ legs), often with pes cavus, and predominantly motor involvement. X-linked and recessively inherited forms of CMT, causing demyelinating or axonal neuropathies, also occur.
## Chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy
The acquired chronic demyelinating neuropathies include chronic inammatory demyelinating peripheral neuropathy (CIDP), multifocal motor neuropathy (see above) and paraprotein-associated demyelinating neuropathy. CIDP typically presents with relapsing or progressive motor and sensory changes, evolving over more than 8 weeks (in distinction to the more acute GBS). It is important to recognise, as it usually responds to intravenous immunoglobulin and other immunotherapies such as glucocorticoids or plasma exchange. Some 10% of patients with acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy
have an abnormal serum paraprotein, sometimes associated with a monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain signicance (MGUS) or lymphoproliferative malignancy. Those with distal sensory involvement and prominent neuropathic tremor may also demonstrate positive antibodies to myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG antibodies).
# Brachial plexopathy
Trauma usually damages either the upper or the lower parts of the brachial plexus, according to the mechanics of the injury. The clinical features depend on the anatomical site of the damage (Box 28.88). Lower parts of the brachial plexus are vulnerable to inltration from breast or apical lung tumours (Pancoast tumour) or damage by therapeutic irradiation. The lower plexus may also be compressed by a cervical rib or brous band between C7 and the rst rib at the thoracic outlet. Neuralgic amyotrophy (also known as brachial neuritis) presents as
an acute brachial plexopathy of probable inammatory origin. Severe shoulder pain precedes the appearance of a patchy upper brachial plexus lesion, with motor and/or sensory involvement. There is no specic treatment and recovery is often incomplete; it may recur in about 25% and there is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary form. The appearance of vesicles should indicate the alternative diagnosis of motor zoster.
## 28.88 Physical signs in brachial plexus lesions

| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Upper plexus**             | Biceps, deltoid, spinati, rhomboids, brachioradialis (triceps, serratus anterior) | Patch over deltoid                      |
| **Lower plexus**             | All small hand muscles, claw hand (ulnar wrist exors)                            | Ulnar border of hand/ forearm           |
| **Thoracic outlet syndrome** | Small hand muscles, ulnar forearm                                                 | Ulnar border of hand/ forearm/upper arm |
# Lumbosacral plexopathy
Lumbosacral plexus lesions may be caused by neoplastic inltration or compression by retroperitoneal haematomas. A small-vessel vasculopathy can produce a unilateral or bilateral lumbar plexopathy in association with diabetes mellitus (‘diabetic amyotrophy’) or an idiopathic form in non-diabetic patients. This presents with painful wasting of the quadriceps with weakness of knee extension and an absent knee reex.
# Spinal root lesions
Spinal root lesions (radiculopathy) are described above. Clinical features include muscle weakness and wasting and dermatomal sensory and reex loss, which reect the pattern of the roots involved. Pain in the muscles innervated by the affected roots may be prominent.

### Summary of Peripheral Nerve Diseases

Peripheral nerve diseases, also known as peripheral neuropathies, involve damage to the peripheral nervous system, which includes nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. These disorders can affect motor, sensory, or autonomic nerves, either alone or in combination.

#### Causes of Peripheral Neuropathy

The causes of peripheral neuropathy are diverse and can be categorized into several groups:

1. **Genetic**: Conditions such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, and familial amyloid polyneuropathy.
2. **Drugs and Toxins**: Certain medications (e.g., amiodarone, chemotherapy agents) and toxins (e.g., alcohol, lead, arsenic) can cause neuropathy.
3. **Vitamin Deficiencies**: Deficiencies in vitamins such as thiamine, pyridoxine, vitamin B12, and vitamin E can lead to neuropathy.
4. **Infections**: Infections like HIV, leprosy, and Lyme disease can cause neuropathy.
5. **Inflammatory and Autoimmune Conditions**: Conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), and vasculitis can cause neuropathy.
6. **Systemic Medical Conditions**: Diabetes, renal failure, and sarcoidosis are among the systemic conditions that can lead to neuropathy.
7. **Malignant Disease**: Infiltration by cancer or paraneoplastic syndromes can cause neuropathy.

#### Pathophysiology

Damage to peripheral nerves can result in either axonal or demyelinating neuropathies. Axonal neuropathies involve damage to the nerve axon, while demyelinating neuropathies involve damage to the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve. The distinction between these two types is crucial because demyelinating neuropathies are more likely to be treatable.

#### Clinical Features

The clinical presentation of peripheral neuropathy depends on the type of nerve affected:

- **Motor Nerve Involvement**: Results in weakness, muscle wasting, and decreased reflexes.
- **Sensory Nerve Involvement**: Can cause pain, numbness, tingling, and sensory loss. Small-fiber neuropathies often present with pain.
- **Autonomic Nerve Involvement**: Can lead to orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal disturbances, and other autonomic dysfunction.

#### Investigations

The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy involves a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and neurophysiological studies:

1. **Initial Tests**: Include blood glucose, full blood count, liver function tests, vitamin B12 levels, and serum protein electrophoresis.
2. **Neurophysiological Tests**: Nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG) are crucial for distinguishing between axonal and demyelinating neuropathies and for diagnosing entrapment neuropathies.

#### Specific Conditions

1. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)**: An acute inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy that can lead to rapid progression of weakness and potentially life-threatening respiratory failure. Treatment with plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin can hasten recovery.
2. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)**: A chronic condition that presents with progressive or relapsing weakness and sensory symptoms. It responds to immunotherapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin, glucocorticoids, or plasma exchange.
3. **Entrapment Neuropathies**: Conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar neuropathy, and peroneal neuropathy result from compression of specific nerves. Symptoms can range from pain and paresthesia to muscle weakness.

#### Management

The management of peripheral neuropathy depends on the underlying cause:

- **Specific Treatments**: Available for certain causes, such as vitamin supplementation for deficiency states, or immunotherapy for inflammatory neuropathies.
- **Supportive Care**: Includes pain management, physical therapy, and measures to prevent complications such as pressure sores and deep vein thrombosis.

Understanding the cause and type of peripheral neuropathy is essential for guiding management and improving outcomes.
