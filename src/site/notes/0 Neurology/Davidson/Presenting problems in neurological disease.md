# Overview
While history is important in all medical specialties, it is especially key in neurology, where many neurological diagnoses have no conrmatory test. History-taking allows doctor and patient to get to know one another; many neurological diseases follow chronic paths and this may be the rst of many such consultations. It also allows the clinician to obtain information about the patient's affect, cognition and psychiatric state. History-taking is a highly active process. While there are generic
templates (Box 28.7), each individual story will follow its own course, and diagnostic considerations during the history will guide further questioning. It is important to be clear about what patients mean by certain words.
They may nd it difcult to describe symptoms: for instance, weakness may be called ‘numbness’, while there are many possible interpretations of ‘dizziness’. These must be claried; even in emergency situations, a clear, accurate history is the foundation of any management plan. While the story should come primarily from the patient, input from eye-witnesses and family members is crucial if the patient is unable to provide details or if there has been loss of consciousness. This need for corroboration and clarication means the telephone is as important as any investigation. The aim of the history is to address two key issues: (1) where is the
lesion; and (2) what is the lesion? (Box 28.8). These should remain uppermost in the doctor's mind while the history is being elicited, especially in older people (Box 28.9). Some common combinations of symptoms may suggest particular locations for a lesion (Box 28.10). Enquiry about handedness is important; lateralisation of the dominant hand helps designate the dominant hemisphere, which in turn may help to localise any pathologies, or to plan rehabilitation or treatment strategies in asymmetrical disorders such as stroke or Parkinson’s disease. Epidemiology must be borne in mind. How likely is it that this particular patient has any specic condition under consideration? For example, a 20-year-old with right-sided headache and tenderness will not have temporal arteritis, but this is an important possibility if such symptoms present in a 78-year-old female. Global epidemiology is important and endemic infectious agents and travel history should always be considered. Determining the evolution, speed of onset and progression of a disease is important (Box 28.11). For example, if right-hand weakness occurred overnight, it would suggest a stroke in an older person or an acute entrapment neuropathy in a younger one. Evolution over several days, however, might make demyelination (multiple sclerosis) a possible diagnosis, or perhaps a subdural haematoma if the weakness was preceded by a head injury in an older person taking warfarin. Progression over weeks might bring an intracranial mass lesion or motor neuron disease into the differential. Slow progression over a year or so, with difculty in using the hand, could suggest a degenerative process such as Parkinson’s disease. The impact on day-to-day activities, such as walking, climbing stairs and carrying out ne hand movements, should also be established in order to gauge the level of associated disability.
Estimates of the frequency and duration of specic events are essential when taking details of a paroxysmal disorder such as migraine and epilepsy. Vague terms such as ‘a lot’ or ‘sometimes’ are unhelpful, and it can assist the patient if choices are given to estimate numbers, such as once a day, week or month. Many neurological symptoms are not explained by typical neurological disease. Describing these as ‘functional’ is less pejorative, more acceptable to patients and more in keeping with modern understanding of these symptoms than ‘psychogenic’ or ‘hysterical’. Functional symptoms require considerable experience in diagnosis and are frequently missed.

 Limb tone: more difcult to assess because of poor relaxation and concomitant joint disease.
 Ankle reexes: may be absent. 
 Gait assessment: more difcult because of concurrent musculoskeletal
disease and pre-existing neurological decits.
 Sensory testing: especially difcult when there is cognitive impairment.

# Headache and facial pain
Most headaches are chronic disorders but acute presentation of headaches is an important aspect of emergency medical care. Headache may be divided into primary (benign) or secondary, and most patients, whether presenting in clinic or as emergencies, have primary syndromes (see Box 9.13). The emergency clinical assessment of headaches is dealt with on page 186.

## Ocular pain
Assuming that ocular disease (such as acute glaucoma) has been excluded, ocular pain may be due to trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) or, rarely, inammatory or inltrative lesions at the apex of the orbit or the cavernous sinus, when 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th cranial nerve involvement is usually evident. Ocular pain and headache are also discussed on page 1223.

## Facial pain
Pain in the face can be due to dental or temporomandibular joint problems. Acute sinusitis is usually apparent from other features of sinus congestion/infection and may cause localised pain over the affected sinus, but is almost never the explanation for persistent facial pain or headache. Facial pain is not uncommon in migraine but some syndromes can
present solely with facial pain. The most common neurological causes of facial pain are trigeminal neuralgia, herpes zoster (shingles) and postherpetic neuralgia, all characterised by their extreme severity. In trigeminal neuralgia, the patient describes bouts of brief (seconds), lancinating pain (‘electric shocks’), most frequently felt in the second and third divisions of the nerve and often triggered by talking or chewing. Facial shingles most commonly affects the rst (ophthalmic) division of the trigeminal nerve, and pain usually precedes the rash. Post-herpetic neuralgia may follow, typically a continuous burning pain throughout the affected territory, with marked sensitivity to light touch (allodynia) and resistance to treatment. Destructive lesions of the trigeminal nerve usually cause numbness rather than pain.

# Dizziness, blackouts and ‘funny turns’
Acute onset of dizziness or blackouts will present to the acute medical department. In neurological practice, it is common to deal with patients presenting with a history of multiple events. While detailed questioning will be dealt with in the relevant section (see p. 185), the neurologist will have to tease out the pattern of each of the different attack types experienced by the patient to be able to form a treatment and investigation plan, one of the challenges of clinical neurology.

# Status epilepticus
Status epilepticus is seizure activity not resolving spontaneously, or recurrent seizure with no recovery of consciousness in between. Persisting seizure activity has a recognised mortality and is a medical emergency. Diagnosis is usually clinical and can be made on the basis of the description of prolonged rigidity and/or clonic movements with loss of awareness. As seizure activity becomes prolonged, movements may become more subtle. Cyanosis, pyrexia, acidosis and sweating may occur, and complications include aspiration, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias and renal or hepatic failure. In patients with pre-existing epilepsy, the most likely cause is a fall
in antiepileptic drug levels. In de novo status epilepticus, it is essential to exclude precipitants such as infection (meningitis, encephalitis), neoplasia and metabolic derangement (hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia or hypocalcaemia). Treatment and investigation are outlined in Box 28.12


### 28.12 Management of status epilepticus
#### Initial
 Ensure airway is patent; give oxygen to prevent cerebral hypoxia 
 Check pulse, blood pressure, BM Stix and respiratory rate 
 Secure intravenous access and initiate ECG monitoring 
 Send blood for:
	Glucose, urea and electrolytes, calcium and magnesium, liver function, antiepileptic drug levels
	Full blood count and coagulation screen 
	Storing a sample for future analysis (e.g. drug misuse)
 If seizures continue for > 5 mins: give midazolam 10 mg bucally or nasally or lorazepam 4 mg IV if access available or diazepam 10 mg rectally or IV if necessary; repeat once only after 15 mins
 Correct any metabolic trigger, e.g. hypoglycaemia, thiamine deciency (give thiamine before glucose if suspected)
#### Ongoing
**If seizures continue after 30 mins** 
 IV infusion with one of: Levetiracetam: 60mg/kg (max dose 4500mg) over 10 minutes Phenytoin: 15 mg/kg at 50 mg/min (with cardiac monitoring, risk of hypotension and bradycardia) Sodium valproate: 20–30 mg/kg IV at 40 mg/min Phenobarbital: 10 mg/kg at 100 mg/min
 Cardiac monitor and pulse oximetry: Monitor neurological condition, blood pressure, respiration; check blood gases
 If severe renal dysfunction with eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2 avoid levetiracetam; sodium valproate is then drug of rst choice
**If seizures still continue after 30–60 mins** 
 Transfer to intensive care: Start treatment for refractory status with intubation, ventilation and general anaesthesia using propofol or thiopental EEG monitor
**Once status controlled** 
 Commence longer-term antiepileptic medication with one of: Levetiracetam 1000–1500 mg IV, oral/nasogastric tube twice daily (adjust for renal impairment and start 10–12 hours after loading dose) Sodium valproate 10 mg/kg IV over 3–5 mins, then 800–2000 mg/day Phenytoin: give loading dose (if not already used as above) of 15 mg/kg, infuse at < 50 mg/min, then 300 mg/day Carbamazepine 400 mg by nasogastric tube, then 400–1200 mg/day
 Investigate cause

# Coma
Coma and loss of consciousness usually present to the acute medical admissions department (p. 197). Clarication of cause and prognosis may require specialist neurological input.
# Delirium
Delirium describes cortical dysfunction and replaces the older term ‘acute confusional state’. It has a range of primary causes, and given its role in precipitating acute admission, it is covered in detail on page 213.

# Amnesia
Memory disturbance is a common symptom. In the absence of signicant functional impairment (e.g. inability to work, dyspraxias, loss of daily function), many patients will prove to have benign memory dysfunction related to age, mood or psychiatric disorders. Investigation and treatment of the dementias are discussed elsewhere (p. 1246). Temporary loss of memory may be due to a transient delirium related
to infection, the post-ictal period after seizure, or transient global amnesia. These are usually distinguished on the basis of the history. Transient amnesia resulting directly from a seizure (transient epileptic amnesia) is a rare result of temporal lobe epilepsy.

## Transient global amnesia
Transient global amnesia (TGA) predominantly affects middle-aged people, with an abrupt, discrete loss of anterograde memory function lasting up to a few hours. During the episode, patients are unable to record new memories, resulting in repetitive questioning, the hallmark of this condition. Consciousness is preserved and patients may perform even complex motor acts normally. During the attack there is retrograde amnesia for the events of the past few days, weeks or years. After 4–6 hours, memory function and behaviour return to normal but the patient has persistent, complete amnesia for the duration of the attack itself. There are no seizure markers and, unlike epileptic amnesia, transient global amnesia recurs in only around 10%–20% of cases. A vascular aetiology is unlikely (TGA is not a risk factor for subsequent vascular disease) and amnesia may be due to a benign process similar to migraine, occurring in the hippocampus. TGA causes no physical signs and, provided there is a typical history (which requires a witness), no investigation is necessary and patients may be reassured.

## Persistent amnesia
Serious neurological disease must be excluded in patients with persistent memory disturbance, although many will prove to have benign symptoms. Symptoms corroborated by relatives or colleagues are likely to be more signicant than those noted by the patient only. Where poor concentration is at the heart of cognitive deterioration, it is more likely to be due to an underlying mood disorder. It is important to assess the timing of onset and to establish which
aspects of memory are affected. Complaints of getting lost or of losing complex abilities are more pathological than word-nding difculties. Disturbance of episodic or working memory (previously called ‘short-term memory’) must be distinguished from semantic memory (memory for concept-based knowledge unrelated to specic experiences). Episodic memory is selectively impaired in Korsakoff syndrome (often secondary to alcohol) or bilateral temporal lobe damage. It can also be seen in conjunction with other types of dementia. Progressive deterioration over months suggests an underlying dementia, and a full medical assessment must be performed to detect any underlying medical problem. It is important to identify and treat depression in patients with memory
loss. Depression may present as a ‘pseudo-dementia’, with concentration and memory impairment as dominant features, and this is often reversible with antidepressant medication. Any patient with dementia (particularly of Alzheimer type) may develop depression in the early stages of their illness, however. Specic causes of progressive dementia, with their investigation and treatment, are described elsewhere (p. 1246).

# Weakness
The assessment of weakness requires the application of basic anatomy, physiology and some pathology to the interpretation of the history and clinical ndings. Points to consider are shown on Figure 28.17 and in Boxes 28.13 and 28.14. The pattern and evolution of weakness and the clinical signs provide clues to the site and nature of the lesion.
It is important to establish whether the patient has loss of power rather
than reduced sensation or generalised fatigue. Pain may restrict movement and thus mimic weakness. Paradoxically, sensory neglect may leave patients unaware of severe weakness. Patients with parkinsonism may complain of weakness; extrapyramidal signs of rigidity (cogwheel or lead pipe) and bradykinesia should be evident, and a resting tremor (usually asymmetrical) may provide a further clue. Simple observation of the patient walking into the consulting room may be diagnostic and is as important as formal strength testing. Movement restricted by pain should be apparent, and other features (contractures, wasting, fasciculations, abnormal movements/postures) all provide diagnostic clues. Weakness is a common symptom arising without an underlying degenerative or destructive cause (functional symptom). Functional weakness does not conform to typical patterns, and the signs in Box 28.13 are absent. Clinical examination is often variable (e.g. the patient can walk but appears to have no leg movement when assessed on the couch), and strength may appear to ‘give way’, with the patient able to achieve full power for brief bursts, which does not occur in disease. Hoover's sign is useful to conrm functional weakness and relies on eliciting the normal phenomenon of simultaneous hip extension when the contralateral hip exes. In functional weakness, hip extension weakness may be seen; this then returns to full strength when contralateral hip exion is tested. This sign may be demonstrated to the patient in a non-confrontational manner, to show that potential limb power is intact.

## Facial weakness
### Facial nerve palsy (Bell's palsy) 
One of the most common causes of facial weakness is Bell's palsy, a lower motor neuron lesion of the 7th (facial) nerve, affecting all ages and both sexes. It is more common following upper respiratory tract infections, during pregnancy and in patients with diabetes, immunosuppression and hypertension. It is common in human immunodeciency virus at the time of seroconversion. The lesion is within the facial canal. Symptoms usually develop subacutely over a few hours, with pain around the ear preceding the unilateral facial weakness. Patients often describe the face as ‘numb’ but there is no objective sensory loss (except to taste, if the chorda tympani is involved). Hyperacusis may occur if the nerve to stapedius is involved and impairment of parasympathetic bres may cause diminished salivation and tear secretion. Examination reveals an ipsilateral lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy (no sparing of forehead muscles). Vesicles in the ear or on the palate may indicate primary herpes zoster infection. A clinical search for signs of other causes of lower motor neuron facial nerve weakness, such as parotid or scalp lesions, trauma or skull base lesions, is justied. Glucocorticoids improve recovery rates if started within 72 hours of
onset but antiviral drugs are not effective. Articial tears applied regularly prevent corneal drying, and taping the eye shut overnight helps prevent exposure keratitis and corneal abrasion. Patients unable to close the eye should be referred urgently to an ophthalmologist. About 80% of patients recover spontaneously within 12 weeks. Plastic surgery may be considered for the minority left with facial disgurement after 12 months. Recurrence is unusual and should prompt further investigation. Aberrant re-innervation may occur during recovery, producing unwanted facial movements, such as eye closure when the mouth is moved (synkinesis) or ‘crocodile tears’ (tearing during salivation). Unlike Bell's palsy, lesions with an upper motor neuron origin may
spare the upper face. Cortical lesions may cause a facial weakness either in isolation or with associated hemiparesis and speech difculties.

# Sensory disturbance
Sensory symptoms are common and frequently benign. Patients often nd sensory symptoms difcult to describe and sensory examination is difcult for both doctor and patient. While neurological disease can cause sensory symptoms, systemic disorders can also be responsible. Tingling in both hands and around the mouth can occur as the result of hyperventilation or hypocalcaemia. When there is dysfunction of the relevant cerebral cortex, the patient's perception of the wholeness or actual presence of the relevant part of the body may be distorted.

## Numbness and paraesthesia
The history may give the best clues to localisation and pathology. Certain common patterns are recognised: in migraine, the aura may consist of spreading tingling or paraesthesia, followed by numbness evolving over 20–30 minutes over one half of the body, often splitting the tongue. Sensory loss caused by a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) occurs much more rapidly and is typically negative (numbness) rather than positive (tingling). Rarely, unpleasant paraesthesia of sensory epilepsy spreads within seconds. The sensory alteration of inammatory spinal cord lesions often ascends from one or both lower limbs to a distinct level on the trunk over hours to days, and can give rise to a feeling of constriction, sometimes described as ‘being hugged’. Sensory change can occur as a manifestation of anxiety or as part of a functional neurological disorder. In such cases, the distribution usually neither conforms to a known anatomical pattern nor ts with any typical neurological disease. Care must be taken in diagnosing functional sensory problems; a careful history and examination will ensure there is no other objective neurological decit. Sensory neurological examination needs to be undertaken and interpreted with care because the ndings depend, by denition, on subjective reports. The reported distribution of sensory loss can be useful, however, when combined with the coexisting decits of motor and/or cranial nerve function (Fig. 28.18).

### [[Davidson Neurology 11.webp|Fig. 28.18 Patterns of sensory loss.]]

### Sensory loss in peripheral nerve lesions 
Here the symptoms are usually of sensory loss and paraesthesia. Single nerve lesions cause disturbance in the sensory distribution of the nerve, whereas in diffuse neuropathies the longest neurons are affected rst, giving a characteristic ‘glove and stocking’ distribution. If smaller nerve bres are preferentially affected (e.g. in diabetic neuropathy), temperature and pin-prick (pain) are reduced, whilst vibration sense and proprioception (modalities served by the larger, well-myelinated, sensory nerves) may be relatively spared. In contrast, vibration and proprioception are particularly affected if the neuropathy is demyelinating in character, producing symptoms of tightness and swelling with impairment of proprioception and vibration sensation.

### Sensory loss in nerve root lesions 
These typically present with pain as a prominent feature, either within the spine or in the limb plexuses. Pain is often felt in the myotome rather than the dermatome. The nerve root involved may be deduced from the dermatomal pattern of sensory loss, although overlap may lead to this being smaller than expected.

### Sensory loss in spinal cord lesions 
Transverse lesions of the spinal cord produce loss of all sensory modalities below that segmental level, although the clinical level may only be manifest 2–3 segments lower than the anatomical site of the lesion. Very often, there is a band of paraesthesia or hyperaesthesia at the top of the area of sensory loss. Clinical examination may reveal dissociated sensory loss, i.e. different patterns in the spinothalamic and dorsal columnar pathways. If the transverse lesion is vascular due to anterior spinal artery thrombosis, the spinothalamic pathways may be affected while the posterior one-third of the spinal cord (the dorsal column modalities) may be spared. Lesions damaging one side of the spinal cord will produce loss of spinothalamic modalities (pain and temperature) on the opposite side, and of dorsal column modalities (joint position and vibration sense) on the same side of the body – the Brown–Séquard syndrome (see Fig. 28.18E). Lesions in the centre of the spinal cord (such as syringomyelia: see
Box 28.82 and Fig. 28.49) spare the dorsal columns but involve the spinothalamic bres crossing the cord from both sides over the length of the lesion. There is no sensory loss in segments above and below the lesion; this is described as ‘suspended’ sensory loss. There is sometimes reex loss at the level of the lesion if afferent bres of the reex arc are affected. An isolated lesion of the dorsal columns is not uncommon in multiple
sclerosis. This produces a characteristic unpleasant, tight feeling over the limb(s) involved and, while there is no loss of pin-prick or temperature sensation, the associated loss of proprioception may severely limit function of the affected limb(s).

### Sensory loss in brainstem lesions 
Lesions in the brainstem can be associated with sensory loss but the distribution depends on the site of the lesion. A lesion limited to the trigeminal nucleus or its sensory projections will cause ipsilateral facial sensory disturbance. For example, pain resembling trigeminal neuralgia can be seen in patients with multiple sclerosis. The anatomy of the trigeminal connections means that lesions in the medulla or spinal cord can give rise to ‘balaclava helmet’ patterns of sensory loss. Sensory pathways running up from the spinal cord can also be damaged in the brainstem, resulting in simultaneous sensory loss in arm(s) and/or leg(s).

### Sensory loss in hemispheric lesions 
The temporal, parietal and occipital lobes receive sensory information regarding the various modalities of touch, vision, hearing and balance (see Box 28.2). The initial points of entry into the cortex are the respective primary cortical areas (see Fig. 28.4). Damage to any of these primary areas will result in reduction or loss of the ability to perceive that particular modality: ‘negative’ symptomatology. Abnormal excitation of these areas can result in a false perception (‘positive’ symptoms), the most common of which is migrainous visual aura (ashing lights or teichopsia). Cortical lesions are more likely to cause a mixed motor and sensory
loss. Substantial lesions of the parietal cortex (as in large strokes) can cause severe loss of proprioception and may even abolish conscious awareness of the existence of the affected limb(s), known as neglect; this can be difcult to distinguish from paralysis. Pathways are so tightly packed in the thalamus that even small lacunar strokes can cause isolated contralateral hemisensory loss.

## Neuropathic pain
Neuropathic pain is a positive neurological symptom caused by dysfunction of the pain perception apparatus, in contrast to nociceptive pain, which is secondary to pathological processes such as inammation. Neuropathic pain has distinctive features and typically provokes a very unpleasant, persistent, burning sensation. There is often increased sensitivity to touch, so that light brushing of the affected area causes exquisite pain (allodynia). Painful stimuli are felt as though they arise from a larger area than that touched, and spontaneous bursts of pain may also occur. Pain may be elicited by other modalities (allodynia) and is considerably affected by emotional inuences. The most common causes of neuropathic pain are diabetic neuropathies, trigeminal and post-herpetic neuralgias, and trauma to a peripheral nerve. Treatment of these syndromes can be difcult. Drugs that modulate various parts of the nociceptive system, such as gabapentin, carbamazepine or tricyclic antidepressants, may help. Localised treatment (topical treatment or nerve blocks) sometimes succeeds but may increase the sensory decit and worsen the situation. Electrical stimulation has occasionally proved successful.

# Abnormal movements
Disorders of movement lead to either extra, unwanted movement (hyperkinetic disorders) or too little movement (hypokinetic disorders) (Box 28.15). In either case, the lesion often localises to the basal ganglia, although some tremors are related to cerebellar or brainstem disturbance. Functional movement disorders are common and may mimic all of the organic syndromes below. The most important hypokinetic disorder is Parkinson’s disease. Parkinsonism is a clinical description of a collection of symptoms, including tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity. While the history is always important, observation is clearly vital; much of the skill in diagnosing movement disorders lies in pattern recognition. Once it is established whether the problem is hypo- or hyperkinetic, the next task is to categorise the movements further, accepting that there is often overlap. Videoing the movements (with the patient's consent), so that they can be shown to a movement disorder expert, may provide a quick diagnosis in cases of uncertainty.

## Tremor
Tremor is caused by alternating agonist/antagonist muscle contractions and produces a rhythmical oscillation of the body part affected. In the assessment of tremor, the position, body part affected, frequency and amplitude should be considered, as these provide diagnostic clues (Box 28.16).

## Other hyperkinetic syndromes
Non-rhythmic involuntary movements include chorea, athetosis, ballism, dystonia, myoclonus and tics. They are categorised by clinical appearance, and coexistence and overlap are common, such as in choreoathetosis.

### Chorea 
Chorea (from the Greek word ‘dance’) refers to abrupt, brief, irregular, purposeless involuntary movements, appearing dgety and clumsy and affecting different areas. They suggest disease in the caudate nucleus (as in Huntington’s disease) and are a common complication of levodopa treatment for Parkinson’s disease. Other causes are shown in Box 28.17

### Athetosis
Slower, writhing movements of the limbs are often combined with chorea and have similar causes.

### Ballism
This more dramatic form of chorea causes often violent inging movements of one limb (monoballism) or one side of the body (hemiballism). The lesion localises to the contralateral subthalamic nucleus and the most common cause is stroke.

### Dystonia 
Sustained involuntary muscle contraction causes abnormal postures or movement. It may be generalised (usually in childhood-onset genetic syndromes) or, more commonly, focal/segmental (such as in torticollis, when the head is twisted repeatedly to one side). Some dystonias occur only with specic tasks, such as writer's cramp or other occupational ‘cramps’. Dystonic tremor is associated, is asymmetrical and of large amplitude.

### Myoclonus
Myoclonus consists of brief, isolated, random jerks of muscle groups. This is physiological at the onset of sleep (hypnic jerks). Similarly, a myoclonic jerk is a component of the normal startle response, which may be exaggerated in some rare (mostly genetic) disorders. Myoclonus may occur in disorders of the cerebral cortex, such as some forms of epilepsy. Alternatively, myoclonus can arise from subcortical structures or, more rarely, from segments of the spinal cord.

### Tics
Tics are stereotyped repetitive movements, such as blinking, winking, head shaking or shoulder shrugging. Unlike dyskinesias, the patient may be able to suppress them, although only for a short time. Isolated tics are common in childhood and usually disappear. Tourette syndrome is dened by the presence of multiple motor and vocal tics that may evolve over time; it is frequently associated with psychiatric disease, including obsessive compulsions, depression, self-harm or attention decit disorder. Tics may also occur in Huntington’s and Wilson’s diseases, or after streptococcal infection.

# Abnormal perception
The parietal lobes are involved in the higher processing and integration of primary sensory information. This takes place in areas referred to as ‘association’ cortex, damage to which gives rise to sensory (including visual) inattention, disorders of spatial perception and disruption of spatially orientated behaviour, leading to apraxia’s. Apraxia is the inability to perform complex, organised activity in the presence of normal basic motor, sensory and cerebellar function (after weakness, numbness and ataxia have been excluded as causes). Examples of complex motor activities include dressing, using cutlery and geographical orientation. Other abnormalities that can result from damage to the association cortex involve difculty reading (dyslexia) or writing (dysgraphia), or the inability to recognise familiar objects (agnosia). The results of damage to particular lobes of the brain are given in Box 28.2

# Altered balance and vertigo
Balance is a complicated dynamic process that requires ongoing modication of both axial and limb muscles to compensate for the effects of gravity and alterations in body position and load (and hence centre of gravity) in order to prevent a person from falling. This requires input from a variety of sensory modalities (visual, vestibular and proprioceptive), processing by the cerebellum and brainstem, and output via a number of descending pathways (e.g. vestibulospinal, rubrospinal and reticulospinal tracts). Disorders of balance can therefore arise from any part of this process. Disordered input (loss of vision, vestibular disorders or lack of joint position sense), processing (damage to vestibular nuclei or cerebellum) or motor function (spinal cord lesions, leg weakness of any cause) can all impair balance. The patient may complain of different symptoms, depending on the location of the lesion. For example, loss of joint position sense or cerebellar function may result in a sensation of unsteadiness, while damage to the vestibular nuclei or labyrinth may result in an illusion of movement, such as vertigo (see below). A careful history is vital. Since vision can often compensate for lack of joint position sense, patients with peripheral neuropathies or dorsal column loss will often nd their problem more noticeable in the dark. Examination of such patients may yield physical signs that again
depend on the site of the lesion. Sensory abnormalities may be manifest as altered visual acuities or visual elds, possibly with abnormalities on fundoscopy, altered eye movements (including nystagmus, impaired vestibular function or lack of joint position sense. Disturbance of cerebellar function may be manifest as nystagmus, dysarthria or ataxia, or difculty with gait (unsteadiness or inability to perform tandem gait; see below). Leg weakness, if present, will be detectable on examination of the limbs.

## Vertigo
Vertigo is dened as an abnormal perception of movement of the environment or self, and occurs because of conicting visual, proprioceptive and vestibular information about a person's position in space. Vertigo commonly arises from imbalance of vestibular input and is within the experience of most people, since this is the ‘dizziness’ that occurs after someone has spun round vigorously and then stops. Bilateral labyrinthine dysfunction often causes some unsteadiness. Labyrinthine vertigo usually lasts days at a time, though it may recur, while vertigo arising from central (brainstem) disorders is often persistent and accompanied by other brainstem signs. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo lasts a few seconds on head movement. A careful history will reveal the likely cause in most patients.

# Abnormal gait
Many neurological disorders can affect gait. Observing patients as they walk into the consulting room can be very informative, although formal examination is also important. Neurogenic gait disorders need to be distinguished from those due to skeletal abnormalities, usually characterised by pain producing an antalgic gait, or limp. Gait alteration incompatible with any anatomical or physiological decit may be due to functional disorders.

## Pyramidal gait
Upper motor neuron lesions cause characteristic extension of the affected leg. The resultant tendency for the toes to strike the ground on walking requires the leg to swing outwards at the hip (circumduction). Nevertheless, a shoe on the affected side worn down at the toes may provide evidence of this type of gait. In hemiplegia, the asymmetry between affected and normal sides is obvious on walking, but in paraparesis both lower limbs swing slowly from the hips in extension and are dragged stify over the ground – described as ‘walking in mud’.

## Foot drop 
In normal walking, the heel is the rst part of the foot to hit the ground. A lower motor neuron lesion affecting the leg will cause weakness of ankle dorsiexion, resulting in a less controlled descent of the foot, which makes a slapping noise as it hits the ground. In severe cases, the foot will have to be lifted higher at the knee to allow room for the inadequately dorsiexed foot to swing through, resulting in a high-stepping gait.

## Myopathic gait 
During walking, alternating transfer of the body's weight through each leg requires adequate hip abduction. In proximal muscle weakness, usually caused by muscle disease, the hips are not properly xed by these muscles and trunk movements are exaggerated, producing a rolling or waddling gait.

## Ataxic gait 
An ataxic gait can result from lesions in the cerebellum, vestibular apparatus or peripheral nerves. Patients with lesions of the central portion of the cerebellum (the vermis) walk with a characteristic broad-based gait ‘as if drunk’ (cerebellar function is particularly sensitive to alcohol). Patients with acute vestibular disturbances walk similarly but the accompanying vertigo is characteristic. Inability to walk heel to toe may be the only sign of less severe cerebellar dysfunction. Proprioceptive defects can also cause an ataxic gait. The impairment of joint position sense makes walking unreliable, especially in poor light. The feet tend to be placed on the ground with greater emphasis, presumably to enhance proprioceptive input, resulting in a ‘stamping’ gait.

## Apraxic gait 
In an apraxic gait, power, cerebellar function and proprioception are normal on examination of the legs. The patient may be able to carry out complex motor tasks (e.g. bicycling motion) while recumbent and yet cannot formulate the motor act of walking. In this higher cerebral dysfunction, the feet appear stuck to the oor and the patient cannot walk. Gait apraxia is a sign of diffuse bilateral hemisphere disease (such as normal pressure hydrocephalus) or diffuse frontal lobe disease.

## Marche à petits pas 
This gait is characterised by small, slow steps and marked instability. It differs from the festination found in Parkinson’s disease (see below), in that it lacks increasing pace and freezing. The usual cause is small-vessel cerebrovascular disease and there may be accompanying bilateral upper motor neuron signs.

## Extrapyramidal gait 
The rigidity and bradykinesia of basal ganglia dysfunction lead to a stooped posture and characteristic gait difculties, with problems initiating walking and controlling the pace of the gait. Patients may become stuck while trying to start walking or when walking through doorways (‘freezing’). The centre of gravity will be moved forwards to aid propulsion, which, with poor axial control, can lead to an accelerating pace of shufing and difculty stopping. This produces the festinant gait: initial stuttering steps that quickly increase in frequency while decreasing in length

# Abnormal speech and language
Speech disturbance may be isolated to disruption of sound output (dysarthria) or may involve language disturbance (dysphasia). Dysphonia (reduction in the sound/volume) is usually due to mechanical laryngeal disruption, whereas dysarthria is more typically neurological in origin. Dysphasia is always neurological and localises to the dominant cerebral hemisphere (usually left, regardless of handedness). Combinations of speech and swallowing problems are explained below.

## Dysphonia
Dysphonia describes hoarse or whispered speech. The most common cause is laryngitis, but dysphonia can also result from a lesion of the 10th cranial nerve or disease of the vocal cords, including laryngeal dystonia. Parkinsonism may cause hypophonia with marked reduction in speech volume, often in association with dysarthria, making speech difcult to understand.

## Dysarthria
Dysarthria is characterised by poorly articulated or slurred speech and can occur in association with lesions of the cerebellum, brainstem and lower cranial nerves, as well as in myasthenia or myopathic disease. Language function is not affected. The quality of the speech tends to differ, depending on the cause, but it can be very difcult to distinguish the different types clinically (Box 28.18). Dysarthria is discussed further in the section on bulbar symptoms below.

## Dysphasia
Dysphasia (or aphasia) is a disorder of the language content of speech. It can occur with lesions over a wide area of the dominant hemisphere (Fig. 28.19). Dysphasia may be categorised according to whether the speech output is uent or non-uent. Fluent aphasias, also called receptive aphasias, are impairments related mostly to the input or reception of language, with difculties either in auditory verbal comprehension or in the repetition of words, phrases or sentences spoken by others. Speech is easy and uent but there are difculties related to the output of language as well, such as paraphasia (either substitution of similar-sounding non-words, or incorrect words) and neologisms (non-existent words). Non-uent aphasias, also called expressive aphasias, are difculties
in articulating, but in most cases there is relatively good auditory verbal comprehension. Examples include Broca aphasia (associated with pathologies in the inferior frontal region), transcortical motor aphasia and global aphasia. ‘Pure’ aphasias are selective impairments in reading, writing or the
recognition of words. These disorders may be quite selective. For example, a person is able to read but not write, or is able to write but not read. Examples include pure alexia, agraphia and pure word deafness.
Dysphasia (a focal symptom) is frequently misinterpreted as disorientation (which is non-focal) and it is important always to consider dysphasia as an alternative explanation for the apparently ‘confused’ patient. Dysphasia can be misheard/misspelt as dysphagia, and for this reason some prefer to use ‘aphasia’ to avoid confusion.

# Disturbance of smell
Symptomatic olfactory loss is most commonly due to local causes (nasal obstruction) but may follow head injury. Hyposmia may predate motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease by many years, although it is rarely noticed by the patient. Frontal lobe lesions are a rare cause. Positive olfactory symptoms may arise in Alzheimer’s disease or epilepsy.

# Visual disturbance and ocular abnormalities
Disturbances of vision may be due to primary ocular disease or to disorders of the central connections and visual cortex. Visual symptoms are usually negative (loss of vision) but sometimes positive, most commonly in migraine. Eye movements may be disturbed, giving rise to double vision (diplopia) or blurred vision. Loss of vision is also discussed on page 1224.

## Visual loss
Visual loss can occur as the result of lesions in any areas between the retina and the visual cortex. Patterns of visual eld loss are explained by the anatomy of the visual pathways (see Fig. 28.7). Associated clinical manifestations are described in Box 30.8. Visual symptoms affecting one eye only are due to lesions anterior to the optic chiasm. Transient visual loss is quite common and sudden-onset visual loss
lasting less than 15 minutes is likely to have a vascular origin. It may be difcult to know whether the visual loss was monocular (carotid circulation) or binocular (vertebrobasilar circulation), and it is important to ask if the patient tried closing each eye in turn to see whether the symptom affected one eye or both. Visual eld testing is an important part of the examination, either at the bedside or formally with perimetry. Field defects become more symmetrical (congruous), the closer the lesion comes to the visual cortex.
Migrainous visual symptoms are very common and, when associated
with typical headache and other migraine features, rarely pose a diagnostic challenge. They may occur in isolation, however, making distinction from TIA difcult, but TIAs typically cause negative (blindness) symptoms, whereas migraine causes positive phenomena (see below). TIAs often last for a shorter time (a few minutes), compared to the 10–60-minute duration of migraine aura, and have an abrupt onset and end, unlike the gradual evolution of a migraine aura.

## Positive visual phenomena
The most common cause is migraine; patients may describe silvery zigzag lines (fortication spectra) or ashing coloured lights (teichopsia), usually preceding the headache. Simple ashes of light (phosphenes) may indicate damage to the retina (e.g. detachment) or to the primary visual cortex. Formed visual hallucinations may be caused by drugs or may be due to epilepsy or ‘release phenomena’ in a blind visual eld (Charles Bonnet syndrome).

## Double vision
Diplopia arises from misalignment of the eyes, meaning that the image is not projected to the same points on the two retinas. At its most subtle it may be reported as blurred rather than double vision. Monocular diplopia indicates ocular disease, while binocular diplopia suggests a neurological cause. Closing either eye in turn will abort binocular diplopia. Once the presence of binocular diplopia is conrmed, it should be established whether the diplopia is maximal in any particular direction of gaze, whether the images are separated horizontally or vertically, and whether there are any associated symptoms or signs, such as ptosis or pupillary disturbance. Binocular diplopia may result from central disorders or from disturbance of the ocular motor nerves, muscles or the neuromuscular junction (see Fig. 28.8). The pattern of double vision, along with any associated features, usually allows the clinician to infer which nerves/muscles are affected, while the mode of onset and other features (e.g. fatigability in myasthenia) provide further clues to the cause. The causes of ocular motor nerve palsies are listed in Box 28.19. Examination ndings are illustrated in Figure 28.20

## Nystagmus
Nystagmus describes a repetitive to-and-fro movement of the eyes. In central lesions, the slow drifts are the primary abnormal movement, each followed by fast (corrective) phases. Nystagmus occurs because the control systems of the eyes are defective, causing them to drift off target; corrections then become necessary to return xation to the object of interest, causing nystagmus. The direction of the fast phase is usually designated as the direction of the nystagmus because it is easier to see. Nystagmus may be horizontal, vertical or torsional, and usually involves both eyes synchronously. It may be a physiological phenomenon in response to sustained vestibular stimulation or movement of the visual world (optokinetic nystagmus). There are many causes of pathological nystagmus, the most common sites of lesions being the vestibular system, brainstem and cerebellum. The brainstem and the cerebellum are involved in maintaining eccentric positions of gaze. Lesions will therefore allow the eyes to drift back in towards primary position, producing nystagmus with fast component beats in the direction of gaze (gaze-evoked nystagmus). This is the most common type of ‘central’ nystagmus; it is most commonly bidirectional and not usually accompanied by vertigo. Other signs of brainstem dysfunction may be evident. Brainstem disease may also cause vertical nystagmus. Unilateral cerebellar lesions may result in gaze-evoked nystagmus
when looking in the direction of the lesion, where the fast phases are directed towards the side of the lesion. Cerebellar hemisphere lesions also cause ‘ocular dysmetria’, an overshoot of target-directed, fast eye movements (saccades) resembling ‘past-pointing’ in limbs. In vestibular lesions, damage to one of the horizontal canals or its connections will allow the tonic output from the healthy contralateral side to cause the eyes to drift towards the side of the lesion. This elicits recurrent compensatory fast movements away from the side of the lesion, manifest as unidirectional horizontal nystagmus. Vertical and torsional components can be seen with damage to other parts of the vestibular apparatus. The nystagmus of peripheral labyrinthine lesions is accompanied by vertigo and usually by nausea, vomiting and unsteadiness, but as the CNS habituates, the nystagmus disappears (fatigues) quite quickly. Central vestibular nystagmus is more persistent. Nystagmus also occurs as a consequence of drug toxicity and nutritional deciency (e.g. thiamin). The severity is variable, and it may or may not result in visual degradation, though it may be associated with a sensation of movement of the visual world (oscillopsia). Nystagmus may occur as a congenital phenomenon, in which case both phases are equal and ‘pendular’, rather than having alternating fast and slow components.

## Ptosis
Various disorders may cause drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and these are listed in Box 28.20 and shown on Figure 28.21

## Abnormal pupillary responses
Abnormal pupillary responses may arise from lesions at several points between the retina and brainstem. Lesions of the oculomotor nerve, ciliary ganglion and sympathetic supply produce characteristic ipsilateral disorders of pupillary function. ‘Afferent’ defects result from damage to an optic nerve, impairing the direct response of a pupil to light, although leaving the consensual response from stimulation of the normal eye intact. Structural damage to the iris itself can also result in pupillary abnormalities. Causes are given in Box 28.21. An example is shown in Figure 28.22

## Papilloedema
There are several causes of swelling of the optic disc but the term ‘papilloedema’ is reserved for swelling secondary to raised intracranial pressure, when obstructed axoplasmic ow from retinal ganglion cells results in swollen nerve bres, which in turn cause capillary and venous congestion, producing papilloedema. Lack of papilloedema never excludes raised intracranial pressure. Optic disc swelling and papilloedema are also discussed on page 1226.

## Optic atrophy 
See Chapter 30.

# Hearing disturbance
Each cochlear organ has bilateral cortical representation, so unilateral hearing loss is a result of peripheral organ damage. Bilateral hearing dysfunction is usual and is most commonly due to age-related degeneration or noise damage, although infection and drugs (particularly diuretics and aminoglycoside antibiotics) can be a primary cause. Prominent deafness may suggest a mitochondrial disorder (see Box 28.92).

# Bulbar symptoms – dysphagia and dysarthria
Swallowing is a complex activity involving the coordinated action of lips, tongue, soft palate, pharynx and larynx, which are innervated by cranial nerves 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Structural causes of dysphagia are considered on page 795. Neurological mechanisms are vulnerable to damage at different points, resulting in dysphagia that is usually accompanied by dysarthria. Tempo is again crucial: acute onset of dysphagia may occur as a result of brainstem stroke or a rapidly developing neuropathy, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome or diphtheria. Intermittent fatigable muscle weakness (including dysphagia) would suggest myasthenia gravis. Dysphagia developing over weeks or months may be seen in motor neuron disease, basal meningitis and inammatory brainstem disease. More slowly developing dysphagia suggests a myopathy or possibly a brainstem or skull-base tumour. Pathologies affecting lower cranial nerves (9, 10, 11 and 12) frequently manifest bilaterally, producing dysphagia and dysarthria. The term ‘bulbar palsy’ is used to describe lower motor neuron lesions, either within the medulla or outside the brainstem. The tongue may be wasted and fasciculating, and palatal movement is reduced.
Upper motor neuron innervation of swallowing is bilateral, so persistent dysphagia is unusual with a unilateral upper motor lesion (the exception being in the acute stages of, for example, a hemispheric stroke). Widespread lesions above the medulla will cause upper motor neuron bulbar paralysis, known as ‘pseudobulbar palsy’. Here the tongue is small and contracted, and moves slowly; the jaw jerk is brisk, and there may be associated emotional variability. Causes of these are shown in Box 28.22

## 28.22 Causes of pseudobulbar and bulbar palsy
| Type                   | Pseudobulbar                              | Bulbar                                                                   |

# Bladder, bowel and sexual disturbance
While isolated disturbances of bladder, bowel and sexual function are rarely the sole presenting features of neurological disease, they are common complications of many chronic disorders such as multiple sclerosis, stroke and dementia, and are frequently found post head injury. Abnormalities in these functions considerably reduce quality of life for patients. Incontinence and its management are discussed elsewhere (pp. 567, 833 and 1305).

## Bladder dysfunction
The anatomy and physiology involved in controlling bladder functions are discussed in Chapter 18, but it is worth emphasising the role of the pontine micturition centre, which is itself under higher control via inputs from the pre-frontal cortex, mid-brain and hypothalamus. In the absence of conscious control (e.g. in coma or dementia), distension of the bladder to near capacity evokes reex detrusor contraction (analogous to the muscle stretch reex), and reciprocal changes in sympathetic activation and relaxation of the distal sphincter result in coordinated bladder emptying. Damage to the lower motor neuron pathways (the pelvic and pudendal
nerves) produces a accid bladder and sphincter with overow incontinence, often accompanied by loss of pudendal sensation. Such damage may be due to disease of the conus medullaris or sacral nerve roots, either within the dura (as in inammatory or carcinomatous meningitis) or as they pass through the sacrum (trauma or malignancy), or due to damage to the nerves themselves in the pelvis (infection, haematoma, trauma or malignancy). Damage to the pons or spinal cord results in an ‘upper motor neuron’ pattern of bladder dysfunction due to uncontrolled over-activity of the parasympathetic supply. The bladder is small and highly sensitive to being stretched. This results in frequency, urgency and urge incontinence. Loss of the coordinating control of the pontine micturition centre will also result in the phenomenon of detrusor–sphincter dyssynergia, in which detrusor contraction and sphincter relaxation are not coordinated; the spastic bladder will often try to empty against a closed sphincter. This manifests as both urgency and an inability to pass urine, which is distressing and painful. The resultant incomplete bladder emptying predisposes to urinary infection, and the prolonged high intravesical pressure may result in obstructive uropathy and renal failure; post-micturition bladder ultrasound may conrm incomplete bladder emptying. More severe lesions of the spinal cord, as in spinal cord compression or trauma, can result in painless urinary retention as bladder sensation, normally carried in the lateral spinothalamic tracts, will be disrupted. Damage to the frontal lobes gives rise to loss of awareness of bladder fullness and consequent incontinence. Coexisting cognitive impairment may result in inappropriate micturition. These features may be seen in hydrocephalus, frontal tumours, dementia and bifrontal subdural haematomas.
When a patient presents with bladder symptoms, it is important to
localise the lesion on the basis of history and examination, remembering that most bladder problems are not neurological unless there are overt neurological signs. Clinical features and management are summarised in Box 28.23

### 28.23 Neurogenic bladder: clinical features and treatment
| Type                                | Site of lesion                                                        | Result                                                                                                                     | Treatment                                                                                    |

## Rectal dysfunction
The rectum has an excitatory cholinergic input from the parasympathetic sacral outow, and inhibitory sympathetic supply similar to the bladder. Continence depends largely on skeletal muscle contraction in the puborectalis and pelvic oor muscles supplied by the pudendal nerves, as well as the internal and external anal sphincters. Damage to the autonomic components usually causes constipation (a common early symptom in Parkinson’s disease) but diabetic neuropathy can be associated with diarrhoea. Lesions affecting the conus medullaris, the somatic S2–4 roots and the pudendal nerves may cause faecal incontinence.

## Erectile failure and ejaculatory failure
These related functions are under autonomic control via the pelvic nerves (parasympathetic, S2–4) and hypogastric nerves (sympathetic, L1–2). Descending inuences from the cerebrum are important for erection but it can occur as a reex phenomenon in response to genital stimulation. Erection is largely parasympathetic and may be impaired by a number of drugs, including anticholinergic, antihypertensive and antidepressant agents. Sympathetic activity is important for ejaculation and may be inhibited by α-adrenoceptor antagonists (α-blockers).

# Personality change
While this is often due to psychiatric illness, neurological conditions that alter the function of the frontal lobes can cause personality change and mood disorder (see Box 28.2). Personality change due to a frontal lobe disorder may occur as the result of structural damage due to stroke, trauma, tumour or hydrocephalus. The nature of any change may help localise the lesion. Patients with mesial frontal lesions become increasingly withdrawn,
unresponsive and mute (abulic), often in association with urinary incontinence, gait apraxia and an increase in tone known as ‘gegenhalten’ or paratonia, in which the patient varies the resistance to movement in proportion to the force exerted by the examiner. Patients with lesions of the dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex develop a dysexecutive syndrome, which involves difculties with speech, motor planning and organisation. Those with orbitofrontal lesions of the frontal lobes, in contrast, become disinhibited, displaying grandiosity or irresponsible behaviour. Memory is substantially intact but frontal release signs may emerge, such as a grasp reex, palmomental response or pout. Proximity to the olfactory bulb and tracts means that inferior frontal lobe tumours may be associated with anosmia. Disturbance to the cortical areas responsible for speech or memory
can result in changes that may be interpreted as changes in personality.

# Sleep disturbance
Disturbances of sleep are common and are not usually due to neurological disease. Patients may complain of insomnia (difculty sleeping), excessive daytime sleepiness, disturbed behaviour during night-time sleep, parasomnia (sleep walking and talking, or night terrors) or disturbing subjective experiences during sleep and/or its onset (nightmares, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis). A careful history (from bed partner as well as patient) usually allows specic causes of sleep disturbance to be identied and these are discussed in more detail on page 1159.

# Psychiatric disorders
Psychiatric disorders may cause or result from neurological problems. Care is needed in their identication, as effective management will help the underlying neurological illness. Mood and sleep disturbance will exacerbate neurological symptoms,
thus increasing disability. The best practitioners have the skill to carry the patient with them when describing the patterns of behaviour contributing to worsening symptoms. Assessment to detect an underlying or exacerbating mood disorder is
vital in all patients, ensuring that depression and anxiety are managed to minimise their secondary effects on neurological symptoms.

### **Core Principles of Neurological Assessment**
1. **History-Taking**:  
   - Critical for diagnosis, as many neurological conditions lack confirmatory tests.  
   - Active process requiring clarification of ambiguous terms (e.g., "weakness" vs. "numbness," "dizziness").  
   - Includes patient affect, cognition, and psychiatric state. Witness input is vital if the patient is impaired.  
   - Aims to answer: **Where is the lesion?** (localization) and **What is the lesion?** (etiology).  

2. **Key Considerations**:  
   - **Epidemiology**: Age, sex, and regional factors (e.g., temporal arteritis in elderly vs. migraine in younger patients).  
   - **Onset and Progression**:  
     - Sudden onset (e.g., stroke, TIA) vs. gradual (e.g., MS, tumor).  
     - Evolution over days/weeks/months guides differential diagnosis.

   - **Primary**: Migraine, cluster headaches.  
   - **Secondary**: Exclude structural causes (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage).  
   - **Trigeminal Neuralgia**: Paroxysmal, electric-like pain; treat with carbamazepine.  

2. **Dizziness/Vertigo**:  
   - **Peripheral**: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).  
   - **Central**: Brainstem/cerebellar lesions; assess for other neurological deficits.  

3. **Status Epilepticus**:  
   - **Management**:  
     - Immediate: Oxygen, IV access, correct metabolic triggers (e.g., hypoglycemia).  
     - First-line: Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam).  
     - Refractory: Anesthesia (e.g., propofol), followed by antiepileptics (levetiracetam, phenytoin).  

4. **Weakness**:  
   - **Upper Motor Neuron (UMN)**: Spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign (e.g., stroke, MS).  
   - **Lower Motor Neuron (LMN)**: Wasting, fasciculations, flaccidity (e.g., ALS, Guillain-Barré).  
   - **Functional Weakness**: Variable exam findings, Hoover’s sign positive.  

5. **Sensory Disturbances**:  
   - **Peripheral Neuropathy**: "Glove-stocking" distribution; differentiate diabetic vs. demyelinating.  
   - **Spinal Cord Lesions**: Sensory levels, dissociated sensory loss (e.g., dorsal column vs. spinothalamic).

   - **Chorea**: Huntington’s disease, drug-induced (e.g., levodopa).  
   - **Myoclonus**: Epileptic or cortical (e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease).  

7. **Cognitive/Behavioral Issues**:  
   - **Amnesia**: Transient global amnesia (TGA) vs. epileptic amnesia.  
   - **Delirium**: Acute confusion; rule out metabolic, infectious, or structural causes.  
   - **Personality Change**: Frontal lobe lesions (e.g., disinhibition, apathy).  

8. **Bulbar Symptoms**:  
   - **Dysphagia/Dysarthria**: LMN (e.g., ALS) vs. UMN (pseudobulbar palsy).  

---

### **Special Considerations**  
- **Elderly Patients**:  
  - Smaller pupils, joint disease affecting tone assessment, absent ankle reflexes.  
- **Functional Neurological Disorders**:  
  - Non-anatomical symptom patterns; avoid confrontational diagnosis.  
- **Emergencies**:  
  - **Coma**: Rule out treatable causes (e.g., hypoglycemia, herniation).  
  - **Neuropathic Pain**: Gabapentin, TCAs, or local treatments.  

---

### **Diagnostic Approach**  
1. **Localize the Lesion**: Use symptom clusters (e.g., hemiparesis + sensory loss = cortical lesion).  
2. **Determine Etiology**: Match clinical features to pathologies (e.g., subacute onset + sensory loss = MS).  
3. **Tailor Management**: Combine history, exam, imaging, and labs (e.g., MRI for MS, EMG for neuropathies).  

This structured approach ensures accurate diagnosis and timely intervention in neurological disorders.

The text discusses the importance of history-taking in neurology, where many diagnoses lack confirmatory tests. It highlights the need to clarify ambiguous terms used by patients and to consider epidemiology, onset, and progression of symptoms. A structured neurological history includes introduction, presenting complaint, and background information. Key clinical syndromes and their management are outlined, including headache, dizziness/vertigo, status epilepticus, weakness, sensory disturbances, abnormal movements, cognitive/behavioral issues, and bulbar symptoms. Special considerations are given to elderly patients and functional neurological disorders. A diagnostic approach is proposed, involving localization of the lesion, determination of etiology, and tailored management combining history, examination, imaging, and laboratory tests.
