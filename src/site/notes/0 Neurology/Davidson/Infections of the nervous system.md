The clinical features of nervous system infections depend on the location of the infection (the meninges or the parenchyma of the brain and spinal cord), the causative organism (virus, bacterium, fungus or parasite), and whether the infection is acute or chronic. The major infections of the nervous system are listed in Box 28.58. The frequency of these varies geographically and in relation to socio-economic level. While certain infections, e.g. tuberculosis and cysticercosis, may not be prevalent in the United Kingdom, they are common in other regions and, therefore, occur in returning travellers or immigrants. Protozoal infections are described in Chapter 13.

# Meningitis
The characteristic clinical features of acute infection of the meninges are pyrexia, headache and meningism. Meningism consists of headache, photophobia and stiffness of the neck, sometimes accompanied by other signs of meningeal irritation, including Kernig's sign (extension at the knee with the hip joint exed causes spasm in the hamstring muscles) and Brudzinski's sign (passive exion of the neck causes exion of the hips and knees). However, as discussed in Chapter 1, meningitis frequently presents without meningism, and although Kernig’s and Brudinski’s signs are specic, their sensitivity can be as low as 5%. Therefore, meningitis should be considered in anyone who presents with fever and headache. Altered level of consciousness may occur and is more common in older people. Abnormalities in the CSF (see Box 28.6) are important in distinguishing the cause of meningitis. Causes of meningitis are listed in Box 28.59

## Viral meningitis
Viruses are the most common cause of meningitis, usually resulting in a benign and self-limiting illness requiring no specic therapy. It is much less serious than bacterial meningitis unless there is associated encephalitis. A number of viruses can cause meningitis (see Box 28.59), the most common being enteroviruses. Where specic immunisation is not employed, the mumps virus is a common cause.

### Clinical features
Viral meningitis occurs mainly in children or young adults, with acute onset of headache and irritability and the rapid development of meningism. The headache is usually the most severe feature. There may be a high pyrexia but focal neurological signs are rare.

### Investigations 
The diagnosis is made by lumbar puncture, with the specic viral cause identied by a nucleic acid amplication test (NAAT). CSF usually contains an excess of lymphocytes. While glucose and protein levels are commonly normal, the latter may be raised. It is important to verify that the patient has not received antibiotics (for whatever cause) prior to the lumbar puncture, as CSF lymphocytosis can also be found in partially treated bacterial meningitis (see [[0 Neurology/Davidson/Investigation of neurological disease#28.6 How to interpret cerebrospinal fluid results\|see box 28.6]])

### Management 
There is no specic treatment and the condition is usually benign and self-limiting. The patient should be treated symptomatically in a quiet environment. Recovery usually occurs within days, although a lymphocytic pleocytosis may persist in the CSF. Meningitis may also occur as a complication of a systemic viral infection such as mumps, measles, infectious mononucleosis, varicella zoster and hepatitis. Whatever the virus, complete recovery without specic therapy is the rule.

## Bacterial meningitis
Many bacteria can cause meningitis but geographical patterns vary, as does age-related sensitivity (Box 28.60). In the ‘meningitis belt’ of sub-Saharan Africa, drought and dust storms are often associated with meningococcal outbreaks (Harmattan meningitis). Bacterial meningitis is usually part of a bacteraemic illness, although direct spread from an adjacent focus of infection in the ear, skull fracture or sinus can be causative. Antibiotics have rendered this less common but mortality and morbidity remain signicant. An important factor in determining prognosis is early diagnosis and the prompt initiation of appropriate therapy. Most bacterial causes of meningitis are normal commensals of the upper respiratory tract. New and potentially pathogenic strains are acquired by droplet spread but close contact is necessary. Epidemics of meningococcal meningitis occur, particularly in cramped living conditions or where the climate is hot and dry. The organism invades through the nasopharynx, producing sepsis and leading to meningitis.

### Pathophysiology 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and Neisseria menin gitidis (meningococcus) are the commonest cause of bacterial meningitis globally, including in the United Kingdom. Streptococcus suis is a rare zoonotic cause of meningitis associated with porcine contact. It is an important cause of meningitis in some parts of Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand. Some degree of hearing loss occurs in more than half of survivors. Infection stimulates an immune response, causing the pia– arachnoid membrane to become congested and inltrated with inammatory cells. The pro-inammatory immune mediators released are particularly prominent in Streptococcus pneumoniae infection and may account for the poor prognosis associated with pneumococcal meningitis. Pus then forms in layers, which may later organise to form adhesions. These may obstruct the free ow of CSF, leading to hydrocephalus, or they may damage the cranial nerves at the base of the brain. Hearing loss is a frequent complication. The CSF pressure rises rapidly, the protein content increases, and there is a cellular reaction that varies in type and severity according to the nature of the inammation and the causative organism. An obliterative endarteritis of the leptomeningeal arteries passing through the meningeal exudate may produce secondary cerebral infarction. Pneumococcal meningitis is often associated with a very purulent CSF and a high mortality, especially in older adults.

### Clinical features 
The most common presenting features are fever and headache, which
may also be associated with drowsiness and meningism. More than 90% of patients have any two of: headache, pyrexia, meningism and altered consciousness. Rash may occur in meningococcal meningitis. In severe bacterial meningitis the patient may be comatose, later developing focal neurological signs. Seizures may occur in around a quarter of patients. When accompanied by sepsis, presenting signs may evolve rapidly, with abrupt onset of obtundation due to cerebral oedema. Complications of meningococcal sepsis are listed in Box 28.61. Chronic meningococcaemia is a rare condition in which the patient can be unwell for weeks or even months with recurrent fever, sweating, joint pains and transient rash. In pneumococcal and Haemophilus infections there may be an accompanying otitis media. Pneumococcal meningitis may be associated with pneumonia and occurs especially in older patients and alcoholics, as well as those with hyposplenism. Listeria monocytogenes causes meningitis and rhombencephalitis (brainstem encephalitis) in the immunosuppressed, people at the extremes of age (neonates and older adults), with diabetes, alcoholics and pregnant women.

### Investigations 
Lumbar puncture is mandatory unless there are contraindications. If the patient is drowsy and has focal neurological signs or seiz ures, is immunosuppressed, has undergone recent neurosurgery or has suffered a head injury, it is wise to obtain a CT to exclude a mass lesion (such as a cerebral abscess) before lumbar puncture because of the risk of coning. This should not, however, delay treatment of presumed meningitis. If lumbar puncture is deferred or omitted, it is essential to take blood cultures and to start empirical treatment (Fig. 28.33). Lumbar puncture will help differentiate the causative organism but the characteristic ndings in bacterial meningitis listed in Box 28.6 are far from universal. If the CSF is abnormal, the safest course is to treat for bacterial meningitis. A bloody tap may complicate CSF ndings. The safest approach is to treat for bacterial meningitis if the white cell count is above normal and disregard the red cell count. Gram lm and culture may allow identication of the organism. Blood cultures may be positive. PCR techniques can be used on both blood and CSF to identify bacterial DNA for several days after antibiotic treatment has started.

#### [[0 Neurology/Davidson/Attachments/Davidson Neurology.png|Fig. 28.33 The investigation of meningitis based on the British Infection Association acute meningitis guideline. ]]

### Management 
There is an untreated mortality rate of around 80%, so action must be swift. Antibiotics should ideally be given after CSF and blood cultures have been obtained, but if there is any delay obtaining these samples, antibiotic therapy should be started immediately. Recommended empirical therapies are outlined in Box 28.62, and the preferred antibiotic when the organism is known after CSF examination is stipulated in Box 28.63. Some regions of the world have a high prevalence of penicillin resistance and local guidelines or microbiologist advice should be sought. There is remarkably little evidence to guide duration of antibiotic treatment. As a guide, pneumococcal meningitis should be treated for 10–14 days, meningococcal meningitis slightly less (around 7 days) and Listeria meningitis for 21 days. Adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy is useful in reducing hearing loss and neurological sequelae in both children and adults in high-income countries, but evidence does not support the use of dexamethasone in lower-income countries or where there are high rates of untreated HIV. In meningococcal disease, mortality is doubled if the patient presents
with features of sepsis rather than meningitis. Individuals likely to require intensive care facilities and expertise include those with cardiac, respiratory or renal involvement, and those with CNS depression prejudicing the airway. Early endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation protect the airway and may prevent the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Adverse prognostic features include hypot ensive shock, a rapidly developing rash, a haemorrhagic diathesis, multisystem failure and age over 60 years.

### Prevention of meningococcal infection 
Close contacts of patients with meningococcal infection (Box 28.64) should be given a single dose of ciprooxacin. Rifampicin for two days is an alternative for those unable to take ciprooxacin. If not treated with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, the index case should be given similar treatment to clear infection from the nasopharynx before hospital discharge. Vaccines are available for most meningococcal subgroups.

## Tuberculous meningitis
Tuberculous meningitis is now uncommon in high-income countries except in immunocompromised individuals, although it is still seen in those born in endemic areas and in low- and middle-resource countries. It is seen more frequently as a secondary infection in patients with HIV infection.

### Pathophysiology 
Tuberculous meningitis most commonly occurs shortly after a primary infection in childhood or as part of miliary tuberculosis. The usual local source of infection is a caseous focus in the meninges or brain substance adjacent to the CSF pathway. The brain is covered by a greenish, gelatinous exudate, especially around the base, and numerous scattered tubercles are found on the meninges.

### Clinical features
The clinical features and staging criteria are listed in Box 28.65. Onset is much slower than in other bacterial meningitis – over 2–8 weeks. If untreated, tuberculous meningitis is fatal in a few weeks but complete recovery is usual if treatment is started at stage I (Box 28.65). When treatment is initiated later, the rate of death or serious neurological decit may be as high as 30%.

### Investigations 
Lumbar puncture should be performed if the diagnosis is suspected. The CSF is under increased pressure. It is usually clear but, when allowed to stand, a ne clot (‘spider web’) may form. The uid contains up to 500 ×106 cells/μL, predominantly lymphocytes, but can contain neutrophils. There is a rise in protein, often marked, and a similarly marked fall in glucose. The tubercle bacillus may be detected in a smear of the centrifuged deposit from the CSF but a negative result does not exclude the diagnosis. The CSF should be cultured but, as this result will not be known for up to 6 weeks, treatment must be started without waiting for conrmation. The WHO recommends use of additional nucleic acid amplication tests (NAATs), specically Xpert MT/RIF Ultra. This should be used in addition to smear and culture studies, as NAATs are not sensitive enough to exclude tuberculous meningitis when negative. Brain imaging may show hydrocephalus, brisk particularly basal meningeal enhancement on enhanced CT or MRI, and/or uncommonly an intracranial tuberculoma.

### Management 
As soon as the diagnosis is made or strongly suspected, chemotherapy should be started using one of the regimens that include pyrazinamide, described on page 522. The use of glucocorticoids in addition to antituberculous therapy has been controversial. Recent evidence suggests that it improves mortality, especially if given early, but not focal neurological damage whether associated with HIV infection or not. Surgical ventricular drainage may be needed if obstructive hydrocephalus develops. Skilled nursing is essential during the acute phase of the illness, and adequate hydration and nutrition must be maintained.

## Fungal meningitis
Fungal meningitis is uncommon and usually occurs in the immunosuppressed. The yeast Cryptococcus neoformans is the commonest and an important cause of meningitis in those immunosuppressed by HIV infection. It does occur in the immunocompetent although non-HIV forms of immunocompromise should be sought. The presentation may be atypical with subacute or chronic meningism, fever, headache and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure occur. The CSF opening pressure is often very raised, with 20–200 cells x106/L mainly lymphocytes, elevated protein and low glucose levels (similar to ndings in tuberculous meningitis) (Box 28.6). In some regions the India ink test and cryptococcal PCR are used to detect cryptococci in the CSF. Cryptococcal antigen is present in the CSF and sometimes serum. Treatment is discussed on p. 363. Treatment of raised CSF pressure may be complex and frequent, sometimes daily, lumbar punctures are required.

## Other meningitides
In some areas, meningitis may be caused by spirochaetes (leptospirosis, Lyme disease and syphilis; rickettsiae (typhus fever) or protozoa (primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, PAM). Meningitis can also be due to non-infective pathologies. This is seen in
recurrent aseptic meningitis resulting from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Behçet’s disease or sarcoidosis, as well as a condition of previously unknown origin known as Mollaret syndrome, in which the recurrent meningitis is associated with epithelioid cells in the spinal uid (‘Mollaret’ cells). Recent evidence suggests that this condition may be due to herpes simplex virus type 2 and is therefore infective after all. Meningitis can also be caused by direct invasion of the meninges by neoplastic cells (‘malignant meningitis’; see Box 28.59).

## Subdural empyema
This is a rare complication of frontal sinusitis, osteomyelitis of the skull vault or middle ear disease. A collection of pus in the subdural space spreads over the surface of the hemisphere, causing underlying cortical oedema or thrombophlebitis. Patients present with severe pain in the face or head and pyrexia, often with a history of preceding paranasal sinus or ear infection. The patient then becomes drowsy, with seizures and focal signs such as a progressive hemiparesis. The diagnosis rests on a strong clinical suspicion in patients with a
local focus of infection. Careful assessment with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI may show a subdural collection with underlying cerebral oedema. Management requires aspiration of pus via a burr hole and appropriate parenteral antibiotics. Any local source of infection must be treated to prevent re-infection.

## Spinal epidural abscess
The characteristic clinical features are back pain, often in a nerve root distribution and progressive transverse spinal cord syndrome with paraparesis, sensory impairment and sphincter dysfunction. There may be fever and raised inammatory markers. Features of the primary focus of infection may be less obvious and thus can be overlooked. The resurgence of resistant staphylococcal infection and injection drug use has contributed to a recent marked rise in incidence. Once the diagnosis is suspected, an MRI scan of the spine should
be carried out (or myelography if MRI is not available). MRI is often negative in early disease, so if it is non-diagnostic and the clinical suspicion remains, it should be repeated after a week or so. Obtaining a bacteriological diagnosis is a high priority, and antibiotics are not usually started until this has been achieved (or at least attempted), e.g. by blood culture and tissue aspiration or biopsy. If there is spinal cord compression surgical treatment is required (e.g. decompressive laminectomy with abscess drainage). However, in the absence of neurological impairment, treatment with antibiotics alone is often attempted, usually using intravenous antibiotics for at least 6 weeks, guided by clinical and biochemical response.

# Parenchymal viral infections
Infection of the substance of the nervous system will produce symptoms of focal dysfunction (decits and/or seizures) with general signs of infection, depending on the acuteness of the infection and the type of organism.

## Viral encephalitis
A range of viruses can cause encephalitis but only a minority of patients report recent systemic viral infection (Box 28.66). The relative importance of specic viruses depends on location and the specic population involved, e.g. immunosuppressed. In high-income countries, the most serious cause of viral encephalitis is herpes simplex, which probably reaches the brain via the olfactory nerves. The development of effective therapy for some forms of encephalitis has increased the importance of clinical diagnosis and virological examination of the CSF.

### Pathophysiology 
The infection provokes an inammatory response that involves the cortex, white matter, basal ganglia and brainstem. The distribution of lesions varies with the type of virus. For example, in herpes simplex encephalitis, the temporal lobes are usually primarily affected, whereas cytomegalovirus can involve the areas adjacent to the ventricles (ventriculitis). Inclusion bodies may be present in the neurons and glial cells, and there is an inltration of polymorphonuclear cells in the perivascular space. There is neuronal degeneration and diffuse glial proliferation, often associated with cerebral oedema.

### Clinical features
Viral encephalitis presents with acute onset of headache, fever, focal neurological signs (aphasia and/or hemiplegia, visual eld defects) and seizures. Disturbance of consciousness ranging from drowsiness to deep coma supervenes early and may advance dramatically. Meningism occurs in many patients. Additional clues to the causative virus are listed in Box 28.66. Rabies presents a distinct clinical picture and is described below.
### Investigations
Imaging by CT scan may show low-density lesions in the temporal lobes but MRI is more sensitive in detecting early abnormalities. Lumbar puncture should be performed once imaging has excluded a mass lesion. The CSF usually contains excess lymphocytes but polymorphonuclear cells may predominate in the early stages. The CSF may be normal in up to 10% of cases. Some viruses, including the West Nile virus, may cause a sustained neutrophilic CSF. The protein content may be elevated but the glucose is normal. The EEG is usually abnormal in the early stages, especially in herpes simplex encephalitis, with characteristic periodic slow-wave activity in the temporal lobes. Virological investigations of the CSF, including PCR, may reveal the causative organism but treatment initiation should not await this.
### Management
Optimum treatment for herpes simplex encephalitis (aciclovir 10 mg/kg IV 3 times daily for 2–3 weeks) has reduced mortality from 70% to around 10%. This should be given early to all patients suspected of having viral encephalitis. Some survivors will have residual epilepsy or cognitive impairment. For
details of post-infectious encephalomyelitis, see page 1163. Antiepileptic treatment may be required and raised intracranial pressure may indicate the need for dexamethasone.

## Brainstem encephalitis
This presents with ataxia, dysarthria, diplopia or other cranial nerve palsies. The CSF is lymphocytic, with a normal glucose. The causative agent is presumed to be viral. However, Listeria monocytogenes may cause a similar syndrome with meningitis (and often a polymorphonuclear CSF pleocytosis) and requires specic treatment with ampicillin (2 grams 6 times daily; see Box 28.63).

## Rabies
Rabies is caused by a rhabdovirus that infects the central nervous tissue and salivary glands of a wide range of mammals. It is usually conveyed by saliva through bites or licks on abrasions or on intact mucous membranes. Humans are most frequently infected from dogs and bats. In Europe, the maintenance host is the fox. The incubation period varies in humans from a minimum of 9 days to many months but is usually between 4 and 8 weeks. Severe bites, especially if on the head or neck, are associated with shorter incubation periods. Human rabies is a rare disease, even in endemic areas. However, because it is usually fatal, major efforts are directed at limiting its spread and preventing its importation into uninfected countries, such as the UK.

### Clinical features
At the onset there may be fever, and paraesthesia at the site of the bite. A prodromal period of 1–10 days, during which the patient becomes increasingly anxious, leads to the characteristic ‘hydrophobia’. Although the patient is thirsty, attempts at drinking provoke violent contractions of the diaphragm and other inspiratory muscles. Delusions and hallucinations may develop, accompanied by spitting, biting and mania, with lucid intervals in which the patient is markedly anxious. Cranial nerve lesions develop and terminal hyperpyrexia is common. Death ensues, usually within a week of the onset of symptoms.

### Investigations
During life, the diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds but rapid immunouorescent techniques can detect antigen in corneal impression smears or skin biopsies.

### Management 
#### Established disease 
Only a few patients with established rabies have survived. All received some post-exposure prophylaxis (see below) and needed intensive care facilities to control cardiac and respiratory failure. Otherwise, only palliative treatment is possible once symptoms have appeared. The patient should be heavily sedated with diazepam, supplemented by chlorpromazine if needed. Nutrition and uids should be given intravenously or through a gastrostomy.
#### Pre-exposure prophylaxis 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis with rabies vaccine is required by those who handle potentially infected animals professionally, work with rabies virus in laboratories or live at special risk in rabies-endemic areas.
#### Post-exposure prophylaxis 
The wounds should be thoroughly cleaned, preferably with a quaternary ammonium detergent or soap; damaged tissues should be excised and the wound left unsutured. Rabies can usually be prevented if treatment is started within a day or two of biting. Delayed treatment may still be of value. For maximum protection, hyperimmune serum and vaccine are required. The safest anti-rabies antiserum is human rabies immunoglobulin. The
dose is 20 IU/kg body weight; half is inltrated around the bite and half is given intramuscularly at a different site from the vaccine. Hyperimmune animal serum may be used but hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are common. The safest vaccine, free of complications, is human diploid cell strain
vaccine. Post-exposure treatment is complex and depends on a composite risk based on the risk by country and the category of exposure. Detailed advice may be available locally or on the UK website https:// www.gov.uk/government/publications/rabies-post-exposure-prophylaxis-management-guidelines. For example, an unimmunised individual from a high-risk country exposed to direct contact with terrestrial mammal saliva should receive human rabies immunoglobulin and four doses of vaccine on days 0, 3, 7 and 21. If immunocompromised, they should receive ve doses of vaccine on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 30. In contrast, an individual in a low-risk country and no physical contact with terrestrial mammal saliva would not require post-exposure prophylaxis.

## Poliomyelitis
Disease is caused by one of three polioviruses, which constitute a subgroup of the enteroviruses. Poliomyelitis has become much less common following the introduction of the Global Polio Eradication initiative. Incidence dropped from more than 350 000 cases in 1988 to 33 in 2018. However, incomplete immunisation still results in small numbers of cases. Transmission usually occurs through faecal–hand–oral contamination with primary replication in the lymphatic tissue of the gastrointestinal and oropharyngeal tracts. The virus causes a lymphocytic meningitis and infects the grey matter
of the spinal cord, brainstem and cortex. There is a particular propensity to damage anterior horn cells, especially in the lumbar segments. Many patients recover fully after the initial phase of a few days of mild
fever and headache. In other individuals, after a week of well-being, there is a recurrence of pyrexia, headache and meningism. Weakness may start later in one muscle group and can progress to widespread paresis. Respiratory failure may supervene if intercostal muscles are paralysed or the medullary motor nuclei are involved. Poliomyelitis virus may be cultured from CSF and stool. Second attacks are very rare but occasionally patients show late deterioration in muscle bulk and power many years after the initial infection (this is termed the ‘post-polio syndrome’). Prevention of poliomyelitis is by immunisation with live Sabin vaccine, a collection of live attenuated polio viruses (OPV – oral poliovirus vaccine) in low- and middle-income regions. The advantages of OPV include cost, ease of administration and transmission of the vaccine virus to unimmunised contacts. In high-income countries where polio is now very rare, the live vaccine has been replaced by the Salk vaccine (IPV), a collection of inactivated polio viruses. Advantages include avoidance of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis and effective combination with other routine childhood vaccines.

## Herpes zoster (shingles)
Herpes zoster is the result of reactivation of the varicella zoster virus that has lain dormant in a nerve root ganglion following chickenpox earlier in life. Reactivation may be spontaneous (as usually occurs in middle-aged or older adults) or due to immunosuppression (as in patients with diabetes, malignant disease or HIV).

## Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
This is a rare, chronic, progressive and eventually fatal complication of measles, presumably a result of an inability of the nervous system to eradicate the virus. It occurs in children and adolescents, usually many years after the primary virus infection. There is generalised neurological deterioration and onset is insidious, with intellectual deterioration, apathy and clumsiness, followed by myoclonic jerks, rigidity and dementia. The CSF may show a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and the EEG demonstrates characteristic periodic bursts of triphasic waves. Although there is persistent measles-specic IgG in serum and CSF, antiviral therapy is ineffective and death ensues within a few years.

## Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy 
This was originally described as a rare complication of lymphoma, leukaemia or carcinomatosis but is seen in untreated HIV/AIDS or secondary to immunosuppression, e.g. following organ transplantation or use of disease-modifying drugs for MS, in particular natalizumab. It is an infection of oligodendrocytes and other neuroglial cells by human polyomavirus JC, causing widespread demyelination of the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. Clinical signs include dementia, hemiparesis and aphasia, which progress rapidly, usually leading to death within weeks or months. Areas of low density in the white matter are seen on CT but MRI is more sensitive, showing diffuse high signal in the cerebral white matter on T2-weighted images, sometimes with contrast enhancement. The only treatment available is restoration of the immune response (by treating HIV/AIDS or reversing immunosuppression) which can lead to the development of an immune reconstitution inammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS).

# Parenchymal bacterial infections
## Cerebral abscess
Bacteria may enter the cerebral substance through penetrating injury, by direct spread from paranasal sinuses or the middle ear, or secondary to sepsis. Untreated congenital heart disease is a recognised risk factor. The site of abscess formation and the likely causative organism are both related to the source of infection (Box 28.68). Initial infection leads to local suppuration followed by loculation of pus within a surrounding wall of gliosis, which in a chronic abscess may form a tough capsule. Haematogenous spread may lead to multiple abscesses.

### Clinical features
A cerebral abscess may present acutely with fever, headache, meningism and drowsiness, but more commonly presents over days or weeks as a cerebral mass lesion with little or no evidence of infection. Seizures, raised intracranial pressure and focal hemisphere signs occur alone or in combination. Distinction from a cerebral tumour may be impossible on clinical grounds.

### Investigations 
Lumbar puncture is potentially hazardous in the presence of raised intracranial pressure and CT should always precede it. CT reveals single or multiple low-density areas, which show ring enhancement with contrast and surrounding cerebral oedema (Fig. 28.34). There may be an elevated white blood cell count and ESR in patients with active local infection. The possibility of cerebral toxoplasmosis or tuberculous disease secondary to HIV infection should always be considered. MRI with diffusion weighted imaging may be helpful in distinguishing between cerebral abscess (hyperintense) and tumour (hypointense or variable increase lower than found in abscess).

### Management and prognosis 
Antimicrobial therapy is indicated once the diagnosis is made. The likely source of infection should guide the choice of antibiotic (see Box 28.68).
Surgical drainage by burr-hole aspiration or excision may be necessary, especially where the presence of a capsule may lead to a persistent focus of infection. Epilepsy frequently develops and is often resistant to treatment. Despite advances in therapy, mortality remains 10%–20% and may partly relate to delay in diagnosis and treatment.

## Lyme disease
Infection with Borrelia burgdorferi can cause numerous neurological problems, including polyradiculopathy, meningitis, encephalitis and mononeuritis multiplex.

## Neurosyphilis
Neurosyphilis may present as an acute or chronic process and may involve the meninges, blood vessels and/or parenchyma of the brain and spinal cord. The decade to 2008 saw a 10-fold increase in the incidence of syphilis. The clinical manifestations are diverse and early diagnosis and treatment are essential.

### Clinical features
The clinical and pathological features of the three most common presentations are summarised in Box 28.69. Neurological examination reveals signs indicative of the anatomical localisation of lesions. Delusions of grandeur suggest general paresis of the insane, but more commonly there is simply progressive dementia. Small and irregular pupils that react to convergence but not light, as described by Argyll Robertson (see Box 28.21), may accompany any neurosyphilitic syndrome but most commonly tabes dorsalis.

### Investigations 
Routine screening for syphilis is warranted in many neurological patients. Treponemal antibodies are positive in the serum in most patients, but CSF examination is essential if neurological involvement is suspected. Active disease is suggested by an elevated cell count, usually lymphocytic, and the protein content may be elevated to 0.5–1.0 g/L. Serological tests in CSF are usually positive but progressive disease can occur with negative CSF serology.

### Management 
Aqueous crystalline penicillin G intravenously or intramuscular injection of procaine benzylpenicillin (procaine penicillin) and probenecid for 10–14 days is essential in the treatment of neurosyphilis of all types. Further courses of penicillin must be given if symptoms are not relieved, if the condition continues to advance or if the CSF continues to show signs of active disease. The cell count returns to normal within 3 months of completion of treatment, but the elevated protein takes longer to subside and some serological tests may never revert to normal. Evidence of clinical progression at any time is an indication for renewed treatment. The spinal cord can be involved by other infections, including HTLV1, TB, bilharzia and echinococcus

# Parenchymal parasitic infections

## Neurocysticercosis
Neurocysticercosis is the commonest parasitic neurological disease globally. Most infections occur in low-resource regions, but it occurs in high-resource regions in travellers and immigrants. Cysts may be asymptomatic, often for years, or symptomatic, the symptoms depending on the site of the cysts. Seizures are the commonest manifestation. Parenchymal cysts occur in the brain or in the convexity sulci, while extraparenchymal cysts occur in the ventricles, cisterns and the spinal cord, and present most often with raised intracranial pressure. Investigation and management are discussed on p. 342.
## Cerebral malaria
Cerebral malaria should be suspected in anyone presenting with fever, altered awareness or behaviour living in or returning from travel to a malaria endemic area. Drowsiness may progress over a few days, but coma can occur within hours. Level of consciousness may uctuate and seizures occur, but focal neurological signs are unusual. The eyes frequently diverge with roving eye movements, but cranial nerve involvement and papilloedema are uncommon and suggest other causes, e.g. meningitis. Cerebral malaria is a serious condition with a case fatality rate of 15%–20% and requires rapid diagnosis and treatment (see Box.13.56).
## Neuroschistosomiasis
Schistosomiasis is commonest in sub-Saharan Africa and neuroschistosomiasis should be considered in individuals in endemic areas and returning travellers presenting with neurological signs. The brain, but more commonly spine (particularly conus medullaris) and cauda equina can be involved. Spinal cord involvement often results in a rapidly progressive transverse myelitis, leg pain, bladder and bowel involvement. Investigation and management are discussed on p. 338.
## Parenchymal fungal infections
Fungal infections of brain parenchyma are uncommon but occur particularly in the immunocompromised, in the presence of intraventricular devices and as an extension of sinus infection
# Diseases caused by bacterial toxins
## Tetanus
This disease results from infection with Clostridium tetani, a commensal in the gut of humans and domestic animals that is found in soil. Infection enters the body through wounds, which may be trivial. It is rare in the UK, occurring mostly in gardeners and farmers, but a recent increase has been seen in injection drug users. By contrast, the disease is common in many countries, where dust contains spores derived from animal and human excreta. Unhygienic practices soon after birth may lead to infection of the umbilical stump or site of circumcision, causing tetanus neonatorum. Tetanus is still one of the major killers of adults, children and neonates in low-income countries, where the mortality rate can be nearly 100% in the newborn and around 40% in others. In circumstances unfavourable to growth of the organism, spores are
formed and these may remain dormant for years in the soil. Spores germinate and bacilli multiply only in the anaerobic conditions that occur in areas of tissue necrosis or if the oxygen tension is lowered by the presence of other organisms, particularly if aerobic. The bacilli remain localised but produce an exotoxin with an afnity for motor nerve endings and motor nerve cells. The anterior horn cells are affected after the exotoxin has passed into
the blood stream and their involvement results in rigidity and convulsions. Symptoms rst appear from 2 days to several weeks after injury: the shorter the incubation period, the more severe the attack and the worse the prognosis.

### Clinical features
By far the most important early symptom is trismus – spasm of the masseter muscles, which causes difculty in opening the mouth and in masticating; hence the name ‘lockjaw’. Lockjaw in tetanus is painless, unlike the spasm of the masseters due to dental abscess, septic throat or other causes. Conditions that can mimic tetanus include functional neurological disorders and phenothiazine overdosage, or overdose in injection drug users. In tetanus, the tonic rigidity spreads to involve the muscles of the
face, neck and trunk. Contraction of the frontalis and the muscles at the angles of the mouth leads to the so-called ‘risus sardonicus’. There is rigidity of the muscles at the neck and trunk of varying degree. The back is usually slightly arched (‘opisthotonus’) and there is a board-like abdominal wall. In the more severe cases, violent spasms lasting for a few seconds
to 3–4 minutes occur spontaneously, or may be induced by stimuli such as movement or noise. These episodes are painful and exhausting, and suggest a grave outlook, especially if they appear soon after the onset of symptoms. They gradually increase in frequency and severity for about 1 week and the patient may die from exhaustion, asphyxia or aspiration pneumonia. In less severe illness, periods of spasm may not commence until a week or so after the rst sign of rigidity, and in very mild infections they may never appear. Autonomic involvement may cause cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension. Rarely, the only manifestation of the disease may be ‘local tetanus’ – stiffness or spasm of the muscles near the infected wound – and the prognosis is good if treatment is commenced at this stage.

### Investigations 
The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds. Laboratory testing supports the diagnosis, but treatment should not be delayed while waiting for results. Wound tissue samples or a wound swab may be sent in cooked meat broth for PCR and culture of C. tetani. Serum samples should be collected, before immunoglobulin is given, for tetanus toxin and antibodies against tetanus toxoid.

### Management 
**Established disease** 
Management of established disease should begin as soon as possible, as shown in Box 28.70

	 Maintain hydration and nutrition 
	 Treat secondary infections 
	 Vaccination following recovery

### Prevention 
Tetanus can be prevented by immunisation and prompt treatment of contaminated wounds by débridement and antibiotics. In patients with a contaminated wound, a 7–10-day course of metronidazole (500 mg intravenously every 6–8 hours) or penicillin G (2–4 million units every 4–6 hours) are recommended. Alternative antibiotics include tetracyclines, macrolides, clindamycin, cephalosporins and chloramphenicol. Tetanus toxoid containing vaccine and human tetanus immunoglobulin use should follow local guidelines, and depend on the level of risk associated with a wound, prior immunisation and time since last tetanus vaccination.

## Botulism
Botulism is caused by the neurotoxins of Clostridium botulinum, which are extremely potent and cause disease after ingestion of even picogram amounts. Its classical form is an acute onset of bilateral cranial neuropathies associated with symmetric descending weakness. Anaerobic conditions are necessary for the organism's growth. It
may contaminate and thrive in many foodstuffs, where sealing and preserving provide the requisite conditions. Contaminated honey has been implicated in infant botulism, in which the organism colonises the gastrointestinal tract. Wound botulism is a growing problem in injection drug users. The toxin causes predominantly bulbar and ocular palsies (difculty
in swallowing, blurred or double vision, ptosis), progressing to limb weakness and respiratory paralysis. Criteria for the clinical diagnosis are shown in Box 28.71 Management includes assisted ventilation and general supportive measures until the toxin eventually dissociates from nerve endings 6–8 weeks following ingestion. A polyvalent antitoxin is available for post- exposure prophylaxis and for the treatment of suspected botulism. It specically neutralises toxin types A, B and E and is not effective against infant botulism (in which active growth of the organism allows continued toxin production).

# Prion diseases
Prions are unique amongst infectious agents in that they are devoid of any nucleic acid. They appear to be transmitted by acquisition of a normal mammalian protein (prion protein, PrPC) that is in an abnormal conformation (PrPSC
, containing an excess of beta-sheet protein). The
result is accumulation of protein that forms amyloid in the CNS, causing a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) across several species. Human prion diseases (Box 28.72) are characterised by the histopathological triad of cortical spongiform change, neuronal cell loss and gliosis. Associated with these changes there is deposition of amyloid, made up of an altered form of a normally occurring protein, the prion protein. Prion proteins are not inactivated by cooking or conventional sterilisation, and transmission is thought to occur by consumption of infected CNS tissue or by inoculation (e.g. via depth EEG electrodes, corneal grafts, cadaveric dura mater grafts and pooled cadaveric growth hormone preparations). The same diseases can occur in an inherited form, due to mutations in the PrP gene. The apparent transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) to humans was thought to be responsible for the emergence of a new variant of Creutzfeld–Jakob disease (vCJD) in the UK (see below). This outbreak led to nationwide precautionary measures, such as leucodepletion of all blood used for transfusion, and the mandatory use of disposable surgical instruments wherever possible for tonsillectomy, appendicectomy and ophthalmological procedures.

## Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) is the best-characterised human TSE. Some 10% of cases arise from a mutation in the gene coding for the prion protein. The sporadic form is the most common, occurring in middle-aged to older patients. Clinical features usually involve a rapidly progressive dementia, with myoclonus and a characteristic EEG pattern (repetitive slow-wave complexes), although a number of other features, such as visual disturbance or ataxia, may also be seen. These are particularly common in CJD transmitted by inoculation (e.g. by infected dura mater grafts). Death occurs after a mean of 4–6 months. There is no effective treatment.
## Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease
This type of CJD (vCJD) emerged in the late 1990s, affecting a small number of patients in the UK. The causative agent appears to be identical to that causing BSE in cows, and the disease may have been a result of the epidemic of BSE in the UK a decade earlier. Patients affected by vCJD are typically younger than those with sporadic CJD and present with neuropsychiatric changes and sensory symptoms in the limbs, followed by ataxia, dementia and death. Progression is slightly slower than in patients with sporadic CJD (mean time to death is over a year). Characteristic EEG changes are not present, but MRI brain scans show typical high-signal changes in the pulvinar thalami in a high proportion of cases (Fig. 28.35). Brain histology is distinct, with very orid plaques containing the prion proteins. Abnormal prion protein has been identied in tonsil specimens from patients with vCJD, leading to the suggestion that the disease could be transmitted by reticulo-endothelial tissue (like TSEs in animals but unlike sporadic CJD in humans). It was the emergence of this form of the disorder that led to the changes in public health and farming policy in the UK; while the incidence of vCJD has declined dramatically, surveillance and research continue.

**Summary: Infections of the Nervous System**

Infections of the nervous system vary in clinical presentation based on the affected area (meninges, brain/spinal cord parenchyma), causative organism, and infection duration (acute/chronic). The prevalence of these infections differs geographically and socio-economically. Below is an organized overview:

### **1. Bacterial Infections**
- **Meningitis**: Presents with fever, headache, meningism (neck stiffness, photophobia), and altered consciousness. Common pathogens include *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Neisseria meningitidis*, and *Haemophilus influenzae*. Treatment involves prompt antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone, vancomycin) and dexamethasone in high-income settings.
- **Tuberculous Meningitis**: Subacute onset with headache, fever, and neurological deficits. CSF shows lymphocytosis, low glucose, and high protein. Treated with antitubercular therapy (e.g., rifampicin, isoniazid) and glucocorticoids.
- **Brain Abscess**: Often secondary to sinus/ear infections or trauma. Symptoms include focal deficits, seizures, and raised intracranial pressure. Management combines antibiotics (e.g., cefotaxime, metronidazole) and surgical drainage.
- **Neurosyphilis**: Manifests as meningovascular disease, general paresis, or tabes dorsalis. Treated with penicillin G.

### **2. Viral Infections**
- **Viral Meningitis**: Typically benign, caused by enteroviruses. CSF shows lymphocytosis. Supportive care suffices.
- **Encephalitis**: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common cause, presenting with fever, seizures, and focal deficits. Treated with aciclovir. Other viruses (e.g., West Nile, Japanese encephalitis) have region-specific prevalence.
- **Rabies**: Fatal once symptomatic, with hydrophobia, agitation, and paralysis. Post-exposure prophylaxis includes wound cleaning, vaccination, and immunoglobulin.
- **HIV-Related Neurological Disease**: Includes HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, opportunistic infections (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis), and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

### **3. Fungal and Parasitic Infections**
- **Cryptococcal Meningitis**: Common in immunocompromised patients. Treated with amphotericin B and flucytosine.
- **Neurocysticercosis**: Caused by *Taenia solium* larvae. Seizures are common. Managed with albendazole and steroids.
- **Cerebral Malaria**: Rapid-onset coma in endemic areas. Treated with artemisinin derivatives.

### **4. Prion Diseases**
- **Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)**: Rapidly progressive dementia with myoclonus. Variant CJD (vCJD) linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). No effective treatment.

### **5. Toxin-Mediated Diseases**
- **Tetanus**: Lockjaw, muscle rigidity, and spasms. Treated with antitoxin, wound debridement, and metronidazole.
- **Botulism**: Descending paralysis from *Clostridium botulinum* toxin. Managed with antitoxin and supportive care.

### **Key Considerations**
- **Diagnosis**: Lumbar puncture (if safe) and imaging (CT/MRI) are critical. CSF analysis guides therapy.
- **Prevention**: Vaccination (e.g., meningococcal, pneumococcal), chemoprophylaxis for contacts, and public health measures.
- **Geographical Variation**: Diseases like tuberculosis, cysticercosis, and arboviral encephalitis are more prevalent in specific regions.

Early recognition and tailored treatment are vital to reduce mortality and neurological sequelae. Immunocompromised individuals require heightened suspicion for opportunistic infections.

### Summary of Infections of the Nervous System

Infections of the nervous system can be caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. The clinical features depend on the location and type of infection.

### Bacterial Infections

*   Meningitis: inflammation of the meninges, causing symptoms such as headache, fever, and neck stiffness.
*   Brain abscess: a collection of pus in the brain, often caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.
*   Other bacterial infections: neurosyphilis, Lyme disease, and tetanus.

### Viral Infections

*   Meningitis: viral meningitis is usually a self-limiting illness, but can be caused by various viruses, including enteroviruses and herpes simplex virus.
*   Encephalitis: inflammation of the brain, often caused by viruses such as herpes simplex virus.
*   Other viral infections: rabies, poliomyelitis, and HIV infection.

### Fungal Infections

*   Meningitis: fungal meningitis is often caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.
*   Other fungal infections: parenchymal fungal infections, such as those caused by Candida and Aspergillus.

### Parasitic Infections

*   Neurocysticercosis: a parasitic infection caused by the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium.
*   Cerebral malaria: a serious complication of malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum.
*   Neuroschistosomiasis: a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma species.

### Prion Diseases

*   Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: a rare, degenerative brain disorder caused by a prion protein.
*   Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: a variant of CJD, linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).

### Management and Treatment

*   Antibiotics and antiviral medications are used to treat bacterial and viral infections, respectively.
*   Antifungal medications are used to treat fungal infections.
*   Antiparasitic medications are used to treat parasitic infections.
*   Supportive care, such as hydration and nutrition, is essential in managing infections of the nervous system.

### Prevention

*   Vaccination: vaccines are available for some infections, such as meningococcal and pneumococcal infections.
*   Vector control: measures to control vectors, such as mosquitoes and ticks, can prevent the spread of infections.
*   Public health measures: measures such as surveillance, outbreak investigation, and education can help prevent the spread of infections.

In conclusion, infections of the nervous system are a diverse group of conditions that require prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent serious complications and improve outcomes. Understanding the causes, clinical features, and management of these infections is essential for healthcare professionals to provide effective care.

  - **Acute Bacterial**: Fever, headache, meningism (neck stiffness, photophobia), altered consciousness, rash (meningococcal).  
  - **Tuberculous**: Subacute onset (2–8 weeks), stages from non-specific symptoms to coma.  
  - **Viral**: Self-limiting, with lymphocytic CSF; HSV encephalitis may cause focal deficits.  

- **Diagnosis**: Lumbar puncture (CSF analysis: elevated opening pressure, lymphocytes/neutrophils, low glucose in bacterial/fungal), PCR, imaging (CT/MRI for abscesses or hydrocephalus).  

- **Management**:  
  - **Bacterial**: Urgent antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone + vancomycin for resistance), dexamethasone adjunct.  
  - **Tuberculous**: Antituberculous therapy (e.g., RIPE regimen), steroids.  
  - **Viral**: Supportive care; acyclovir for HSV.

#### **2. Encephalitis**
- **Causes**: HSV (most severe), arboviruses (West Nile, Japanese encephalitis), HIV, rabies.  
- **Features**: Fever, altered consciousness, seizures, focal neurological deficits. HSV affects temporal lobes.  
- **Diagnosis**: MRI (temporal lobe lesions), CSF PCR, EEG (periodic discharges).  
- **Management**: Acyclovir (HSV), antiretrovirals (HIV), supportive care for rabies (palliative).

#### **3. Brain Abscess/Subdural Empyema**
- **Etiology**: Hematogenous spread, sinus/ear infections, trauma. Common pathogens: *Streptococcus*, *Staphylococcus*, anaerobes.  
- **Features**: Headache, focal deficits, seizures, raised intracranial pressure.  
- **Diagnosis**: Contrast-enhanced CT/MRI (ring-enhancing lesions).  
- **Treatment**: Antibiotics (e.g., cefotaxime + metronidazole), surgical drainage.  

---

#### **4. Spinal Epidural Abscess**
- **Features**: Back pain, fever, progressive weakness, sphincter dysfunction.  
- **Diagnosis**: MRI (gold standard), blood cultures.  
- **Management**: Drainage + IV antibiotics (e.g., nafcillin + metronidazole); surgery if neurological deficits.  

---

#### **5. Prion Diseases**
- **Examples**: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant CJD (linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy).  
- **Features**: Rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, ataxia. MRI shows pulvinar hyperintensity in vCJD.  
- **Management**: Supportive; no cure. Prevent transmission via surgical instrument precautions.

#### **6. Neurological Complications of Systemic Infections**
- **HIV**: Encephalopathy, opportunistic infections (toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus), stroke.  
- **Rabies**: Hydrophobia, encephalitis; fatal once symptomatic. Post-exposure prophylaxis (vaccine + immunoglobulin) is critical.  
- **Tuberculosis**: Meningitis, tuberculomas; treated with RIPE + steroids.  
- **Parasitic**: Neurocysticercosis (seizures), cerebral malaria (coma, mortality 15–20%), schistosomiasis (myelopathy).  

---

#### **7. Bacterial Toxins**
- **Tetanus**: *Clostridium tetani* toxin causes rigidity (trismus, opisthotonus), spasms. Managed with antitoxin, metronidazole, and ICU support.  
- **Botulism**: Foodborne/wound *C. botulinum* toxin causes descending paralysis. Treated with antitoxin and ventilation.  

---

**Key Takeaways**  
- **Urgency**: Bacterial meningitis/abscesses require rapid diagnosis and treatment to reduce mortality.  
- **CSF Analysis**: Critical for differentiating bacterial (low glucose, neutrophils) vs. viral (lymphocytes, normal glucose).  
- **Imaging**: CT/MRI essential for abscesses, encephalitis, or structural complications.  
- **Prevention**: Vaccination (meningococcal, pneumococcal, polio), chemoprophylaxis (contacts of meningococcal cases), and infection control.  

This summary highlights the diversity of nervous system infections, emphasizing pathogen-specific management and the importance of timely intervention.
