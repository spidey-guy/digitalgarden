Acute management of headache is dealt with on page 186, but management of chronic, complex, or refractory headaches may require specialist input. Headaches may be classied as primary or secondary, depending on the underlying cause (see Box 9.13). Secondary headache may be due to structural, infective, inammatory or vascular conditions, discussed later in this chapter. Primary headache syndromes are described here.

# Tension-type headache
This is the most common type of headache and is experienced to some degree by the majority of the population.

## Pathophysiology
Tension-type headache is incompletely understood, and some consider that it is simply a milder version of migraine; certainly, the original notion that it is due primarily to muscle tension (hence the unsatisfactory name) has long since been dismissed. Anxiety about the headache itself may lead to continuation of symptoms, and patients may become convinced of a serious underlying condition.

## Clinical features 
The pain of tension headache is characterised as ‘dull’, ‘tight’ or like a ‘pressure’, and there may be a sensation of a band round the head or pressure at the vertex. It is of constant character and generalised, but often radiates forwards from the occipital region. It may be episodic or persistent, although the severity may vary, and there is no associated vomiting or photophobia. Tension-type headache is rarely disabling and patients appear well. The pain often progresses throughout the day. Tenderness may be present over the skull vault or in the occiput but is easily distinguished from the triggered pains of trigeminal neuralgia and the exquisite tenderness of temporal arteritis. Analgesics may be taken with chronic regularity, despite little effect, and may perpetuate the symptoms (see ‘Medication overuse headache’ below).

## Management 
Most benet is derived from a careful assessment, followed by discussion of likely precipitants and reassurance that the prognosis is good. The concept of medication overuse headache needs careful explanation. An important therapeutic step is to allow patients to realise that their problem has been taken seriously and rigorously assessed. Physiotherapy (with muscle relaxation and stress management) may help and low-dose amitriptyline can provide benet. Investigation is rarely required. The reassurance value of brain imaging needs careful assessment: the pick-up rate of structural abnormalities is exceedingly low, and signicantly outweighed by the likelihood of identifying an incidental and irrelevant nding (e.g. an arachnoid cyst, Chiari I malformation or vascular abnormality). The value of such ‘reassurance’ is usually over-estimated by doctors and patients alike.

# Migraine
Migraine usually appears before middle age, or occasionally in later life; it affects about 20% of females and 6% of males at some point in life. Migraine is usually readily identiable from the history, although unusual variants can cause uncertainty.

## Pathophysiology 
The cause of migraine is unknown but there is increasing evidence that the aura (see below) is due to dysfunction of ion channels causing a spreading front of cortical depolarisation (excitation) followed by hyperpolarisation (depression of activity). This process (the ‘spreading depression of Leão’) spreads over the cortex at a rate of about 3 mm/min, corresponding to the aura's symptomatic spread. The headache phase is associated with vasodilatation of extracranial vessels and may be relayed by hypothalamic activity. Activation of the trigeminovascular system is probably important. A genetic contribution is implied by the frequently positive family history, and similar phenomena occurring in disorders such as CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) or mitochondrial disease (p. 1197). The female preponderance and the frequency of migraine attacks at certain points in the menstrual cycle also suggest hormonal inuences. Oestrogen-containing oral contraception sometimes exacerbates migraine and increases the very small risk of stroke in patients who suffer from migraine with aura. Doctors and patients often over-estimate the role of dietary precipitants such as cheese, chocolate or red wine. When psychological factors contribute, the migraine attack often occurs after a period of stress, being more likely on Friday evening at the end of the working week or at the beginning of a holiday.

## Clinical features 
Some patients report a prodrome of malaise, irritability or behavioural change for some hours or days. Around 20% of patients experience an aura and are said to have migraine with aura (previously known as classical migraine). The aura may manifest as almost any neurological symptom but is most often visual, consisting of fortication spectra, which are usually positive phenomena such as shimmering, silvery zigzag lines marching across the visual elds for up to 40 minutes, sometimes leaving a trail of temporary visual eld loss (scotoma). Sensory symptoms characteristically spreading over 20–30 minutes, from one part of the body to another, are more common than motor ones, and language function can be affected, leading to similarities with TIA/stroke. Isolated aura may occur (i.e. the neurological symptoms are not followed by headache). The 80% of patients with characteristic headache but no ‘aura’ are
said to have migraine without aura (previously called ‘common’ migraine). Migraine headache is usually severe and throbbing, with photophobia, phonophobia and vomiting lasting from 4 to 72 hours. Movement makes the pain worse and patients prefer to lie in a quiet, dark room. In a small number of patients, the aura may persist, leaving more permanent neurological disturbance. This persistent migrainous aura may occur with or without evidence of brain infarction.

## Management 
Avoidance of identied triggers or exacerbating factors (such as the combined contraceptive pill) may prevent attacks. Treatment of an acute attack consists of simple analgesia with aspirin, paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inammatory agents. Nausea may require an antiemetic such as metoclopramide or domperidone. Severe attacks can be aborted by one of the ‘triptans’ (e.g. sumatriptan), which are potent 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) agonists. These can be administered via the oral, subcutaneous or nasal route. Caution is needed with ergotamine preparations because they may lead to dependence. Overuse of any analgesia, including triptans, may contribute to medication overuse headache. If attacks are frequent (more than two per month), prophylaxis should
be considered. Many drugs can be chosen but the most frequently used are vasoactive drugs (β-adrenoceptor antagonists (β-blockers), candesartan, lisinopril), antidepressants (amitriptyline, dosulepin) and antiepileptic drugs (topiramate). Consideration needs to be given to the teratogenicity of antiepileptic drugs in women of childbearing potential. Monoclonal antibodies to calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor are available for refractory migraine. Women with aura should avoid oestrogen treatment for either oral contraception or hormone replacement, although the increased risk of ischaemic stroke is minimal.

# Medication overuse headache
With increasing availability of over-the-counter medication, headache syndromes perpetuated by analgesia intake are becoming much more common. Medication overuse headache (MOH) can complicate any headache syndrome but is especially common with migraine and chronic tension-type headache. The most frequent culprits are compound analgesics (particularly codeine and other opiate-containing preparations) and triptans, and MOH is usually associated with use on more than 10–15 days per month. Management is by withdrawal of the responsible analgesics. Patients
should be warned that the initial effect will be to exacerbate the headache, and migraine prophylactics may be helpful in reducing the rebound headaches. Relapse rates are high, and patients often need help and support in withdrawing from analgesia; a careful explanation of this paradoxical concept is vital.

# Cluster headache
Cluster headaches (also known as migrainous neuralgia) are much less common than migraine. Unusually for headache syndromes, there is a signicant male predominance and onset is usually in the third decade.

## Pathophysiology 
The cause is unknown but this type of headache differs from migraine in many ways, suggesting a different pathophysiological basis. Although uncommon, it is the most common of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia syndromes. Functional imaging studies have suggested abnormal hypothalamic activity. Patients are more often smokers with a higher than average alcohol consumption.

## Clinical features
Cluster headache is strikingly periodic, featuring runs of identical headaches beginning at the same time for weeks at a stretch (the ‘cluster’). Patients may experience either one or several attacks within a 24-hour period, and typically are awoken from sleep by symptoms (‘alarm clock headache’). Cluster headache causes severe, unilateral periorbital pain with autonomic features, such as ipsilateral tearing, nasal congestion and conjunctival injection (occasionally with the other features of a Horner syndrome). The pain, though severe, is characteristically brief (30–90 minutes). In contrast to the behaviour of those with migraine, patients are highly agitated during the headache phase. The cluster period is typically a few weeks, followed by remission for months to years, but a small proportion do not experience remission.

## Management 
Acute attacks can usually be halted by subcutaneous injections of sumatriptan or inhalation of 100% oxygen. The brevity of the attack probably prevents other migraine therapies from being effective. Migraine prophylaxis is often ineffective too but attacks can be prevented in some patients by verapamil, sodium valproate, or short courses of oral glucocorticoids. Patients with severe debilitating clusters can be helped with lithium therapy, although this requires monitoring.

# Trigeminal neuralgia
This is characterised by unilateral lancinating facial pain, most commonly involving the second and/or third divisions of the trigeminal nerve territory, usually in patients over the age of 50 years.

## Pathophysiology 
For most, trigeminal neuralgia remains an idiopathic condition but there is a suggestion that it may be due to an irritative lesion involving the trigeminal root zone, in some cases an aberrant loop of artery. Other compressive lesions, usually benign, are occasionally found. Trigeminal neuralgia associated with multiple sclerosis may result from a plaque of demyelination in the brainstem.

## Clinical features
The pain is repetitive, severe and very brief (seconds or less). It may be triggered by touch, a cold wind or eating. Physical signs are usually absent, although the spasms may make the patient wince and sit silently (tic douloureux). There is a tendency for the condition to remit and relapse over many years. Rarely, there may be combined features of trigeminal neuralgia and cluster headache (‘cluster–tic’).

## Management 
The pain often responds to carbamazepine. It is wise to start with a low dose and increase gradually, according to effect. In patients who cannot tolerate carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, amitriptyline or glucocorticoids may be effective alternatives, but if medication is ineffective or poorly tolerated, surgical treatment should be considered. Decompression of the vascular loop encroaching on the trigeminal root is often performed and may lead to pain relief in some cases. Otherwise, localised injection of alcohol or phenol into a peripheral branch of the nerve may be effective.

# Headaches associated with specic activities
These usually affect men in their thirties and forties. Patients develop a sudden, severe headache with exertion, including sexual activity. There is usually no vomiting or neck stiffness, and the headache lasts less than 10–15 minutes, though a less severe dullness may persist for some hours. Subarachnoid haemorrhage needs to be excluded by CT and/or CSF examination (see Fig. 29.13) after a rst event. The pathogenesis of these headaches is unknown. Although frightening, attacks are usually brief and patients may need only reassurance and simple analgesia for the residual headache. The syndrome may recur, and prevention may be necessary with propranolol or indometacin.

# Other headache syndromes
A number of rare headache syndromes produce pains about the eye similar to cluster headaches (Box 28.24). These include chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and SUNCT (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headaches with conjunctival injection and tearing). The recognition of these syndromes is useful because they often respond to specic treatments such as indometacin.

# Summary

## Qwen 3 235b
**Summary of Primary Headache Syndromes**

**Classification**  
Headaches are categorized as **primary** (migraine, tension-type, cluster, trigeminal neuralgia, and rare variants) or **secondary** (due to structural, infectious, or systemic causes). This summary focuses on primary syndromes.

---

### **1. Tension-Type Headache**  
- **Pathophysiology**: Most common primary headache; linked to stress, muscle tension, and central pain processing abnormalities. Distinct from migraine, though overlap exists.  
- **Features**:  
  - Dull, pressure-like, or tight pain (non-pulsating), often generalized or radiating from the occiput.  
  - No nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia; not disabling.  
  - Chronic use of analgesics may perpetuate symptoms (medication overuse headache).  
- **Management**:  
  - Reassurance, stress reduction, and physiotherapy.  
  - Low-dose amitriptyline for prophylaxis. Avoid frequent analgesic use.  

---

### **2. Migraine**  
- **Pathophysiology**: Cortical spreading depression (aura), trigeminovascular activation, and genetic/hormonal influences (e.g., estrogen).  
- **Features**:  
  - **With Aura** (20%): Visual disturbances (fortification spectra), sensory/linguistic symptoms, followed by headache.  
  - **Without Aura** (80%): Throbbing, unilateral pain with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea; worsened by activity.  
  - Duration: 4–72 hours.  
- **Management**:  
  - **Acute**: NSAIDs, triptans (e.g., sumatriptan), antiemetics (e.g., metoclopramide).  
  - **Prophylaxis**: β-blockers (propranolol), anticonvulsants (topiramate), antidepressants (amitriptyline), or CGRP inhibitors for refractory cases.  
  - Avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives in patients with aura due to increased stroke risk.  

---

### **3. Medication Overuse Headache (MOH)**  
- **Etiology**: Caused by frequent use (>10–15 days/month) of analgesics (e.g., triptans, codeine).  
- **Management**:  
  - Withdrawal of offending agents (expect initial worsening).  
  - Prophylactic medications (e.g., amitriptyline) to reduce rebound.  
  - Patient education on paradoxical causation.  

---

### **4. Cluster Headache**  
- **Pathophysiology**: Hypothalamic dysfunction; associated with smoking and alcohol.  
- **Features**:  
  - Severe, unilateral periorbital pain with ipsilateral tearing, nasal congestion, or Horner syndrome.  
  - Attacks last 30–90 minutes, occur in clusters (weeks/months), often awaken patients at night.  
- **Management**:  
  - **Acute**: Subcutaneous sumatriptan or 100% oxygen.  
  - **Prophylaxis**: Verapamil, prednisolone, or lithium. Surgical decompression for refractory cases.  

---

### **5. Trigeminal Neuralgia**  
- **Pathophysiology**: Neurovascular compression (e.g., aberrant artery) or demyelination (e.g., MS).  
- **Features**:  
  - Paroxysmal, electric-shock-like pain in trigeminal nerve distribution (V2/V3), triggered by touch/cold.  
  - No neurological deficits; remits and relapses over years.  
- **Management**:  
  - First-line: Carbamazepine (titrate gradually).  
  - Alternatives: Oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, or surgical decompression for refractory cases.  

---

### **6. Activity-Related Headaches**  
- **Exertional/Sexual Activity**: Sudden, severe "thunderclap" headache; exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage via CT/lumbar puncture.  
  - **Management**: Propranolol or indomethacin for prevention.  
- **SUNCT/SUNA**: Short-lasting unilateral pain with autonomic features; responsive to indomethacin.  

---

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Diagnosis**: Relies on clinical history (e.g., aura timing, pain characteristics).  
- **Red Flags**: New-onset headache in older adults, neurological deficits, or thunderclap onset require imaging to exclude secondary causes.  
- **Management**: Avoid overuse of acute medications; emphasize patient education and tailored prophylaxis.  

This structured approach aids in differentiating and managing primary headache syndromes effectively.

## GLM 4

The provided text, "activeNote," is a comprehensive overview of various headache syndromes, their pathophysiology, clinical features, and management strategies. Here's a summary of the key points:

**Headache Classification:**

*   Headaches are classified as primary or secondary.
*   Secondary headaches result from underlying conditions like structural, infectious, inflammatory, or vascular issues.
*   Primary headaches are not caused by another condition and include tension-type headaches, migraines, and cluster headaches.

**Tension-Type Headache:**

*   Most common type of headache.
*   Pathophysiology is not fully understood, but it's not primarily caused by muscle tension.
*   Symptoms include dull, tight, or pressure-like pain, often described as a band around the head.
*   Management focuses on reassurance, identifying triggers, and sometimes physiotherapy or low-dose amitriptyline.

**Migraine:**

*   Affects about 20% of females and 6% of males.
*   Pathophysiology involves cortical spreading depression and vasodilation.
*   Clinical features include:
    *   Prodrome (malaise, irritability)
    *   Aura (visual, sensory, or language disturbances) in about 20% of patients
    *   Severe, throbbing headache lasting 4-72 hours
    *   Photophobia, phonophobia, and vomiting
