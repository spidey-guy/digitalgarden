Many different types of mass lesion may arise within the intracranial cavity (Box 28.73). In low-income countries tuberculoma and other infections are frequent causes, but in the West intracranial haemorrhage and brain tumours are more common. The clinical features depend on the site of the mass, its nature and its rate of expansion. Symptoms and signs (see Box 28.74) are produced by a number of mechanisms.

# Raised intracranial pressure
Raised intracranial pressure (RICP) may be caused by mass lesions, cerebral oedema, obstruction to CSF circulation leading to hydrocephalus, impaired CSF absorption and cerebral venous obstruction (see Box 28.73).

## Clinical features
In adults, intracranial pressure is less than 10–15 mmHg. The features of RICP are listed in Box 28.74. The speed of pressure increase inuences presentation. If it is slow, compensatory mechanisms may occur, including alteration in the volume of uid in CSF spaces and venous sinuses, minimising symptoms. Rapid pressure increase (as in aggressive tumours) does not permit these compensatory mechanisms to take place, leading to early symptoms, including sudden death. Papilloedema is not always present, either because the pressure rise has been too rapid or because of anatomical anomalies of the meningeal sheath of the optic nerve. A false localising sign is one in which the pathology is remote from
the site of the expected lesion; in RICP, the 6th cranial nerve (unilateral or bilateral) is most commonly affected but the 3rd, 5th and 7th nerves may also be involved. Sixth nerve palsies are thought to be due either to stretching of the long slender nerve or to compression against the petrous temporal bone ridge. Transtentorial herniation of the uncus may compress the ipsilateral 3rd nerve and usually involves the pupillary bres rst, causing a dilated pupil; however, a false localising contralateral 3rd nerve palsy may also occur, perhaps due to extrinsic compression by the tentorial margin. Vomiting, coma, bradycardia and arterial hypertension are later features of RICP. The rise in intracranial pressure from a mass lesion may cause displacement of the brain. Downward displacement of the medial temporal lobe (uncus) through the tentorium due to a large hemisphere mass may cause ‘temporal coning’ (Fig. 28.36). This may stretch the 3rd and/or 6th cranial nerves or cause pressure on the contralateral cerebral peduncle (giving rise to ipsilateral upper motor neuron signs) and is usually accompanied by progressive coma. Downward movement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum may compress the medulla – ‘tonsillar coning’ (Fig. 28.37). This may result in brainstem haemorrhage and/ or acute obstruction of the CSF pathways. As coning progresses, coma and death occur unless the condition is rapidly treated.

### [[0 Neurology/Davidson/Attachments/Davidson Neurology 4.png|Fig. 28.37 Tonsillar cone.]]

## Management
Primary management of RICP should be targeted at relieving the cause (e.g. surgical decompression of mass lesion, glucocorticoids to reduce vasogenic oedema or shunt procedure to relieve hydrocephalus). Supportive treatment includes maintenance of uid balance, blood pressure control, head elevation and use of diuretics such as mannitol. Intensive care support may be needed.

# Brain tumours
Primary brain tumours are a heterogeneous collection of neoplasms arising from the brain tissue or meninges and vary from benign to highly malignant. Primary malignant brain tumours (Box 28.75) are rare, accounting for 1% of all adult tumours but a higher proportion in children. The most common benign brain tumour is a meningioma. Primary brain tumours do not metastasise due to the absence of lymphatic drainage in the brain. There are rare pathological subtypes, however, such as medulloblastoma, which do have a propensity to metastasise; the reasons for this are not clear. Most cerebral tumours are sporadic but may be associated with genetic syndromes such as neurobromatosis or tuberous sclerosis. Brain tumours are not classied by the usual TNM system but by the World Health Organization (WHO) grading I–IV; this is based on histology (e.g. nuclear pleomorphism, presence of mitoses and presence of necrosis), with grade I the most benign and grade IV the most malignant. Gliomas account for 60% of brain tumours, with the aggressive glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) the most common glioma, followed by meningiomas (20%) and pituitary tumours (10%). Although the lower-grade gliomas (I and II) may be very indolent, with prognosis measured in terms of many years, these may transform to higher-grade disease at any time, with a resultant sharp decline in life expectancy. Most malignant brain tumours are due to metastases, with intracranial
metastases complicating about 20% of extracranial malignancies. The rate is higher with primaries in the bronchus, breast and gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 28.38). Metastases usually occur in the white matter of the cerebral or cerebellar hemispheres but there are diffuse leptomeningeal types.

## Clinical features 
The presentation is variable and usually inuenced by the rate of growth. High-grade disease (WHO grades III and IV) tends to present with a short (weeks) history of mass effect (headache, nausea secondary to RICP), while more indolent tumours can present with slowly progressive focal neurological decits, depending on their location (see Box 28.74); generalised or focal seizures are common in either. Headache, if present, is usually accompanied by focal decits or seizures, and isolated stable headache is almost never due to intracranial tumour. The size of the primary tumour is of far less prognostic signicance
than its location within the brain. Tumours within the brainstem will result in early neurological decits, while those in the frontal region may be quite large before symptoms occur.

## Investigations 
Diagnosis is by neuroimaging (Figs. 28.39 and 28.40) and pathological grading following biopsy or resection where possible. The more malignant tumours are more likely to demonstrate contrast enhancement on imaging. If the tumour appears metastatic, further investigation to nd the primary is required.

### [[0 Neurology/Davidson/Attachments/Davidson Neurology 1.jpg|Fig. 28.40 Magnetic resonance image of an acoustic neuroma (arrows) in the posterior fossa compressing the brainstem.]]

## Management 
Brain tumours are treated with a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, depending on the type of tumour and the patient. Advancing age is the most powerful negative prognostic factor in CNS tumours, so best supportive care (including glucocorticoid therapy) may be most appropriate in older patients with metastases or high-grade disease. Treatment may not always be indicated in low-grade gliomas and watchful waiting may be appropriate, although a more aggressive approach is increasingly favoured. Dexamethasone given orally (or intravenously where RICP is acutely or
severely raised) may reduce the vasogenic oedema typically associated with metastases and high-grade gliomas. Prolactin- or growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas may
respond well to treatment with dopamine agonists (such as bromocriptine, cabergoline or quinagolide); in this situation, imaging and hormone levels may be all that is required to establish a formal diagnosis, precluding the need for surgery.

### Surgical 
The mainstay of primary treatment is surgery, either resection (full or partial debulking) or biopsy, depending on the site and likely radiological diagnosis. Clearly, if a tumour occurs in an area of brain that is highly important for normal function (e.g. motor strip), then biopsy may be the only safe surgical intervention but, in general, maximal safe resection is the optimal surgical management. Meningiomas and acoustic neuromas offer the best prospects for complete removal and thus cure. Some meningiomas can recur, however, particularly those of the sphenoid ridge, when partial excision is often all that is possible. Thereafter, post-operative surveillance may be required, as radiotherapy is effective at preventing further growth of residual tumour. Pituitary adenomas may be removed by a trans-sphenoidal route, avoiding the need for a craniotomy. Unfortunately, gliomas, which account for the majority of brain tumours, cannot be completely excised, since inltration spreads well beyond the apparent radiological boundaries of the intracranial mass. Recurrence is therefore the rule, even if the mass of the tumour is apparently removed completely; partial excision (‘debulking’) may be useful in alleviating symptoms caused by RICP, but although there is increasing evidence that the degree of surgical excision may have a positive inuence on survival, this has not yet been convincingly demonstrated.

### Radiotherapy and chemotherapy
In the majority of primary CNS tumours, radiation and chemotherapy are used to control disease and extend survival rather than for cure. Meningioma and pituitary adenoma offer the best chance of life-long remission. The gliomas are incurable; high-grade, WHO grade IV disease still carries a median survival of just over 1 year. In this situation, patient and family should always be involved in decisions regarding treatment. The diagnosis, and often the symptoms, are devastating, and support from palliative care and social work is crucial at an early stage. In WHO grade III disease, prognosis is a little better (2–4 years), and in rarer, more indolent tumours very prolonged survival is possible. Advances have been made recently in terms of therapeutic outcome.
Standard care for WHO grade IV glioblastoma multiforme is now combination radiotherapy with temozolomide chemotherapy; although this improves median survival of the population from only 12 to 14.5 months, up to 25% of patients survive for more than 2 years (compared to approximately 10% with radiotherapy alone). Ten percent will survive more than 5 years with temozolomide (virtually unheard of with radiotherapy alone). Benets are more likely in well-debulked patients who are younger and tter. Implantation of chemotherapy gives a small survival benet. Understanding of the molecular biology of brain tumours has allowed the use of biomarkers to guide therapy and prognostic discussions.
In patients with methylation of the promoter region of the MGMT (methyl guanine methyl transferase) gene (about 30% of the population) within the tumour, 2-year survival is almost 50%. MGMT reduces the cytotoxicity of temozolomide and this mutation also reduces the enzyme's activity, rendering the tumour more sensitive to chemotherapy. In grade II and III gliomas, the presence of the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 1p19q chromosomal abnormality confers chemosensitivity and thus improves prognosis. The presence of a rare mutation in the IDH-1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase) gene confers a more favourable prognosis in patients with glioblastoma. There is a small group of highly malignant grade IV tumours that
can be cured with aggressive therapy. Medulloblastomas have a good chance of long-term remission with maximal surgery followed by irradiation of the whole brain and spine; younger patients may also benet from concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy. Older patients do not tolerate this, however. Once tumours relapse, chemotherapy response rates are low and survival is short in high-grade disease. In the more uncommon low-grade tumours, repeated courses of chemotherapy can result in much more prolonged survival. In metastatic disease, radiotherapy offers a modest improvement
in survival but with costs in terms of quality of life; treatment therefore needs careful discussion with the patient. Benets may be superior in breast cancer but there is little to separate other pathologies. Occasional chemosensitive cancers, such as small-cell lung cancer, may benet from systemic chemotherapy but intracerebral metastases represent a late stage of disease and have a short prognosis.

## Prognosis 
The WHO histological grading system is a powerful predictor of prognosis in primary CNS tumours, though it does not yet take account of individual biomarkers. For each tumour type and grade, advancing age and deteriorating functional status are the next most important negative prognostic features. The overall 5-year survival rate of about 14% in adults masks a wide variation that depends on tumour type.

## Acoustic neuroma
This is a benign tumour of Schwann cells of the 8th cranial nerve, which may arise in isolation or as part of neurobromatosis type 2 (see below). When sporadic, acoustic neuroma occurs after the third decade and is more frequent in females. The tumour commonly arises near the nerve's entry point into the medulla or in the internal auditory meatus, usually on the vestibular division. Acoustic neuromas account for 80%–90% of tumours at the cerebellopontine angle.

### Clinical features 
Acoustic neuroma typically presents with unilateral progressive hearing loss, sometimes with tinnitus. Vertigo is an unusual symptom, as slow growth allows compensatory brainstem mechanisms to develop. In some cases, progressive enlargement leads to distortion of the brainstem and/or cerebellar peduncle, causing ataxia and/or cerebellar signs in the limbs. Distortion of the fourth ventricle and cerebral aqueduct may cause hydrocephalus (see below), which may be the presenting feature. Facial weakness is unusual at presentation but facial palsy may follow surgical removal of the tumour. The tumour may be identied incidentally on cranial imaging.
### Investigations
MRI is the investigation of choice (see Fig. 28.40).

### Management
Surgery is the treatment of choice. If the tumour can be completely removed, the prognosis is excellent, although deafness is a common complication of surgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery (radiotherapy) may be appropriate for some lesions.

## Neurobromatosis
Neurobromatosis encompasses two clinically and genetically separate conditions, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The more common neurobromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, half of which are new mutations. NF1 is characterised by neurobromas (benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours) and skin involvement (Fig. 28.41), and may affect numerous systems (Box 28.76). Neurobromatosis type 2 (NF2) is caused by mutations of the NF2 gene on chromosome 22 and is characterised by schwannomas (benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours comprising Schwann cells only) with little skin involvement; the clinical manifestations are more restricted to the eye and nervous system (see Box 28.76). Malignant change may occur in NF1 neurobromas but is rare in NF2 schwannomas. The prevalence of NF1 and NF2 is about 20–50 per 100 000 and 1.5 per 100 000, respectively.

## Von Hippel–Lindau disease
This rare autosomal dominant disease is caused by mutations of the VHL tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 3. It promotes development of tumours affecting the kidney, adrenal gland, CNS, eye, inner ear, epididymis and pancreas, which may undergo malignant change. Benign haemangiomas and haemangioblastomas affect about 80% of patients and are mostly cerebellar and retinal.

# Paraneoplastic neurological disease
Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes often present before the underlying tumour declares itself and cause considerable disability. They are discussed in full on page 1165.

# Hydrocephalus
Hydrocephalus is the excessive accumulation of CSF within the brain, and may be caused either by increased CSF production, by reduced CSF absorption, or by obstruction of the circulation (Fig. 28.42). Symptoms range from none to sudden death, depending on the speed at which and degree to which hydrocephalus develops. The causes are listed in Box 28.77. The terms ‘communicating’ and ‘non-communicating’ (also known as obstructive) hydrocephalus refer to blockage either outside or within the ventricular system, respectively (Fig. 28.43).

## Normal pressure hydrocephalus
Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a controversial entity, said to involve intermittent rises in CSF pressure, particularly at night. It is described in old age as being associated with a triad of gait apraxia, dementia and urinary incontinence.
### Management 
Diversion of the CSF by means of a shunt placed between the ventricular system and the peritoneal cavity or right atrium may result in rapid relief of symptoms in obstructive hydrocephalus. The outcome of shunting in NPH is much less predictable and, until a good response can be predicted, the management of individual cases will remain uncertain.

# Idiopathic intracranial hypertension
This usually occurs in young women with high BMI. The annual incidence is about 3 per 100 000. RICP occurs in the absence of a structural lesion, hydrocephalus or other identiable cause. The aetiology is uncertain but there is an association with obesity in females, perhaps inducing a defect of CSF reabsorption by the arachnoid villi. A number of drugs may be associated, including tetracycline, vitamin A and retinoid derivatives.

## Clinical features 
The usual presentation is with headache, sometimes accompanied by diplopia and visual disturbance (most commonly, transient obscurations of vision associated with changes in posture). Clinical examination reveals papilloedema but little else. False localising cranial nerve palsies (usually of the 6th nerve) may be present. It is important to record visual elds accurately for future monitoring.

## Investigations 
Brain imaging is required to exclude a structural or other cause (e.g. cerebral venous sinus thrombosis). The ventricles are typically normal in size or small (‘slit’ ventricles). The diagnosis may be conrmed by lumbar puncture, which shows raised normal CSF constituents at increased pressure (usually > 30 cmH2
O CSF).

## Management 
Management can be difcult and there is no evidence to support any
specic treatment. Weight loss in overweight patients may be helpful if it can be achieved. Acetazolamide or topiramate may help to lower intracranial pressure, the latter perhaps aiding weight loss in some patients. Repeated lumbar puncture is an effective treatment for headache but may be technically difcult in obese individuals and is often poorly tolerated. Patients failing to respond, in whom chronic papilloedema threatens vision, may require optic nerve sheath fenestration or a lumbo-peritoneal shunt.

# Head injury
Diagnosis of head trauma is usually clear either from the history or from signs of external trauma to the head. Brain injury is more likely with skull fracture but can occur without. Individual cranial nerves may be damaged in fractures of the facial bones or skull base. Intracranial effects can be substantial and take several forms: extradural haematoma (collection of blood between the skull and dura); subdural haematoma (collection of blood between the dura and the surface of the brain); intracerebral haematoma; or diffuse axonal injury. Whatever pathology occurs, the resultant RICP may lead to coning
(see Figs. 28.36 and 28.37). Haematomas are identied by CT and management is by surgical drainage, usually via a burr hole. Penetrating skull fractures lead to increased infection risk. Long-term sequelae include headache, cognitive decline and depression, all contributing to signicant social, work, personality and family difculties. Subdural haematoma may occur spontaneously, particularly in
patients on anticoagulants, in old age and with alcohol misuse. There may or may not be a history of trauma. Patients present with subacute impairment of brain function, both globally (obtundation and coma) and focally (hemiparesis, seizures). Headache may not be present. The diagnosis should always be considered in those who present with reduced conscious level. Beyond the immediate consequences of brain injury, there is increasing suspicion of long-term consequences, including dementia, postulated after either single (moderate or severe) injuries or even after multiple mild injuries, such as in boxers. If substantiated, this would encourage more effort to go into prevention of repeated brain injury in sporting contexts

### Summary of Intracranial Mass Lesions and Raised Intracranial Pressure

**Overview:**
Intracranial mass lesions can arise from various causes, including tumors, infections, and hemorrhages. The clinical presentation depends on the location, nature, and rate of expansion of the mass. Raised intracranial pressure (RICP) is a critical complication that can result from mass lesions, cerebral edema, hydrocephalus, or venous sinus obstruction.

**Common Causes of Raised Intracranial Pressure:**
1. **Mass Lesions:**
   - Intracranial hemorrhage (extradural, subdural, intracerebral).
   - Cerebral tumors (e.g., gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary tumors).
   - Infections (cerebral abscess, tuberculoma, cysticercosis).
   - Colloid cysts.
2. **Disturbance of CSF Circulation:**
   - Obstructive (non-communicating) hydrocephalus.
   - Communicating hydrocephalus.
3. **Obstruction to Venous Sinuses:**
   - Cerebral venous thrombosis.
   - Trauma-related sinus obstruction.
4. **Diffuse Brain Edema or Swelling:**
   - Meningo-encephalitis.
   - Trauma.
   - Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   - Metabolic causes (e.g., water intoxication).
   - Idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

**Clinical Features of Intracranial Mass Lesions:**
- **Seizures:** Focal onset with possible generalization.
- **Focal Symptoms:** Weakness, numbness, dysphasia, cranial neuropathy.
- **False Localizing Signs:** Unilateral/bilateral 6th nerve palsies, contralateral 3rd nerve palsies.
- **Raised Intracranial Pressure:** Headache, vomiting, diplopia, papilloedema, bradycardia, impaired consciousness.
- **Stroke/TIA-like Symptoms:** Acute hemorrhage into tumor, paroxysmal ‘tumor attacks’.
- **Cognitive/Behavioral Changes:** Often associated with frontal lobe masses.
- **Endocrine Abnormalities:** Pituitary tumors.
- **Incidental Findings:** Asymptomatic masses detected on imaging.

**Management of Raised Intracranial Pressure:**
- **Primary Management:** Surgical decompression, glucocorticoids, shunt procedures.
- **Supportive Treatment:** Fluid balance, blood pressure control, head elevation, diuretics (e.g., mannitol).
- **Intensive Care:** May be required for severe cases.

**Brain Tumors:**
- **Primary Brain Tumors:** Heterogeneous, ranging from benign to malignant. Gliomas (60%), meningiomas (20%), and pituitary tumors (10%) are most common.
- **WHO Grading:** Based on histology (I–IV), with grade IV being the most malignant.
- **Clinical Features:** Variable presentation depending on growth rate and location. High-grade tumors often present with RICP symptoms.
- **Investigations:** Neuroimaging (MRI/CT) and biopsy/resection for grading.
- **Management:** Surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy. Dexamethasone for edema. Prognosis depends on grade, location, and patient factors.

**Hydrocephalus:**
- **Causes:** Congenital (aqueduct stenosis, Chiari malformations) and acquired (mass lesions, infections).
- **Types:** Communicating and non-communicating (obstructive).
- **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH):** Controversial, associated with gait apraxia, dementia, and urinary incontinence.
- **Management:** Shunt placement for obstructive hydrocephalus; uncertain outcomes for NPH.

**Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension:**
- **Presentation:** Headache, diplopia, visual disturbances, papilloedema.
- **Management:** Weight loss, acetazolamide, topiramate, lumbar puncture, shunting in severe cases.

**Head Injury:**
- **Types:** Extradural, subdural, intracerebral hematomas, diffuse axonal injury.
- **Management:** Surgical drainage, infection prevention, long-term sequelae management.

**Conclusion:**
Intracranial mass lesions and raised intracranial pressure are complex conditions requiring prompt diagnosis and tailored management. Understanding the underlying causes, clinical features, and treatment options is crucial for optimal patient outcomes.
