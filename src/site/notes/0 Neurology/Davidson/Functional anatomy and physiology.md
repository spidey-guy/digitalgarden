# Cells of the nervous system
The nervous system comprises billions of specialised cells, forming a spectacular network of connections. In addition to neurons, there are many types of glial cells. Astrocytes form the structural framework for neurons and control their biochemical environment, their foot processes adjoining small blood vessels and forming the blood–brain barrier (Fig. 28.1). Oligodendrocytes are responsible for the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath, which surrounds axons and is essential for maintaining the speed and consistency of action potential propagation along axons. Peripheral nerves have axons invested in myelin made by oligodendrocytes (Schwann cells). Microglial cells derive from monocytes/macrophages and play a role in ghting infection and removing damaged cells. Ependymal cells line the cerebral ventricles.

## Generation and transmission of the nervous impulse
The role of the central nervous system (CNS) is to generate outputs in response to external stimuli and changes in internal conditions. The CNS has to maintain a delicate balance between responsivity to external stimuli and remaining stoic enough to remain stable in a rapidly changing environment. Each neuron receives input by synaptic transmission from dendrites (branched projections of other neurons), which sum to produce output in the form of an action potential that is then conducted along the axon, resulting in synaptic transmission to other neurons or, in the motor system, to muscle cells. Summation of the inputs causes net changes in the target neuron's electrochemical gradient, which, if large enough, will trigger an action potential. Communication between cells is by synaptic transmission that involves the release of neurotransmitters to interact with structures on the target cell's surface, including ion channels and other receptors (Fig. 28.2).
At least 20 different neurotransmitters act at different sites in the nervous system, most of which are potentially amenable to pharmacological manipulation. Each neuronal cell body may receive synaptic input from thousands
of other neurons. The synapsing neuron terminals are also subject to feedback regulation via receptor sites on the pre-synaptic membrane, modifying the release of transmitter across the synaptic cleft. In addition to such acute effects, some neurotransmitters produce long-term modulation of metabolic function or gene expression. This effect probably underlies more complex processes such as long-term memory.

# Functional anatomy of the nervous system
Major components of the nervous system and their inter-relationships are depicted in Figure 28.3
[[Davidson Neurology 1.webp|Fig. 28.3 The major anatomical components of the nervous system.]]

## Cerebral hemispheres
The cerebral hemispheres coordinate the highest level of nervous function, the anterior half dealing with executive (‘doing’) functions and the posterior half constructing a perception of the environment. Each cerebral hemisphere has four functionally specialised lobes (Box 28.2 and Fig. 28.4), with some functions being distributed asymmetrically (‘lateralised’), to produce cerebral dominance for functions such as motor control, speech or memory. Cerebral dominance aligns limb dominance with language function: in right-handed individuals the left hemisphere is almost always dominant, while around half of left-handers have a dominant right hemisphere. Frontal lobes are concerned with executive function, movement, behaviour and planning. As well as the primary and supplementary motor cortex, there are specialised areas for control of eye movements, speech (Broca's area) and micturition.
The parietal lobes integrate sensory perception. The primary sensory
cortex lies in the post-central gyrus of the parietal lobe. Much of the remainder is devoted to ‘association’ cortex, which processes and interprets input from the various sensory modalities. The supramarginal and angular gyri of the dominant parietal lobe form part of the language area (p. 1144). Close to these are regions dealing with numerical function. The non-dominant parietal lobe is concerned with spatial awareness and orientation. The temporal lobes contain the primary auditory cortex and primary
vestibular cortex. On the inner medial sides lie the olfactory and parahippocampal cortices, which are involved in memory function. The temporal lobes also link intimately to the limbic system, including the hippocampus and the amygdala, which are involved in memory and emotional processing. The dominant temporal lobe also participates in language functions, particularly verbal comprehension (Wernicke's area). Musical processing occurs across both temporal lobes, rhythm on the dominant side and melody/pitch on the non-dominant. The occipital lobes are responsible for visual interpretation. The contralateral visual hemield is represented in each primary visual cortex, with surrounding areas processing specic visual submodalities such as colour, movement or depth, and the analysis of more complex visual patterns such as faces. Deep to the grey matter in the cortices, and the white matter (composed of neuronal axons), are collections of cells known as the basal ganglia that are concerned with motor control; the thalamus, which is responsible for the level of attention to sensory perception; the limbic system, concerned with emotion and memory; and the hypothalamus, responsible for homeostasis, such as temperature and appetite control. The cerebral ventricles contain cerebrospinal uid (CSF), which cushions the brain during cranial movement. CSF is formed in the lateral ventricles and protects and nourishes
the CNS. CSF ows from third to fourth ventricles and through foramina in the brainstem to dissipate over the surface of the CNS, eventually being reabsorbed into the cerebral venous system (see Fig. 28.42).

### [[Davidson Neurology 2.webp|Fig. 28.4 Anatomy of the cerebral cortex.]]

## The brainstem
In addition to containing all the sensory and motor pathways entering and leaving the hemispheres, the brainstem houses the nuclei and projections of most cranial nerves, as well as other important collections of neurons in the reticular formation (Fig. 28.5). Cranial nerve nuclei provide motor control to muscles of the head (including face and eyes) and coordinate sensory input from the special sense organs and the face, nose, mouth, larynx and pharynx. They also relay autonomic messages, including pupillary, salivary and lacrimal functions. The reticular formation is mainly involved in control of conjugate eye movements, the maintenance of balance and arousal, and cardiorespiratory control.

### [[Davidson Neurology 3.webp|Fig. 28.5 Anatomy of the brainstem.]]

## The spinal cord
The spinal cord is the route for virtually all communication between the extracranial structures and the CNS. Afferent and efferent bres are grouped in discrete bundles but collections of cells in the grey matter are responsible for lower-order motor reexes and the primary processing of sensory information.

## Sensory peripheral nervous system
The sensory cell bodies of peripheral nerves are situated just outside the spinal cord, in the dorsal root ganglia in the spinal exit foramina, while the distal ends of their neurons utilise various specialised endings for the conversion of external stimuli into action potentials. Sensory nerves consist of a combination of large, fast, myelinated axons (which carry information about joint position sense and commands to muscles) and smaller, slower, unmyelinated axons (which carry information about pain and temperature, as well as autonomic function).

## Motor peripheral nervous system
The anterior horns of the spinal cord comprise cell bodies of the lower motor neurons. To increase conduction speed, peripheral motor nerve axons are wrapped in myelin produced by Schwann cells. Motor neurons release acetylcholine across the neuromuscular junction, which changes the muscle end-plate potential and initiates muscle contraction.

## The autonomic system
The autonomic system regulates the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract, and many exocrine and endocrine glands throughout the body. The autonomic system is controlled centrally by diffuse modulatory systems in the brainstem, limbic system, hypothalamus and frontal lobes, which are concerned with arousal and background behavioural responses to threat. Autonomic output divides functionally and pharmacologically into two divisions: the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems.

## The motor system
A programme of movement formulated by the pre-motor cortex is converted into a series of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the motor cortex that are transmitted to the spinal cord in the pyramidal tract (Fig. 28.6). This passes through the internal capsule and the ventral brainstem before crossing (decussating) in the medulla to enter the lateral columns of the spinal cord. The pyramidal tract ‘upper motor neurons’ synapse with the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord grey matter, which form the lower motor neurons. Any movement necessitates changes in posture and muscle tone, sometimes in quite separate muscle groups to those involved in the actual movement. The motor system consists of a hierarchy of controls that maintain body posture and muscle tone, on which any movement is superimposed. In the grey matter of the spinal cord, the lowest order of the motor hierarchy controls reex responses to stretch. Muscle spindles sense lengthening of the muscle; they provide the afferent side of the stretch reex and initiate a monosynaptic reex leading to protective or reactive muscle contraction. Inputs from the brainstem are largely inhibitory. Polysynaptic connections in the spinal cord grey matter control more complex reex actions of exion and extension of the limbs that form the basic building blocks of coordinated actions, but complete control requires input from the extrapyramidal system and the cerebellum.

### [[Davidson Neurology 4.webp|Fig. 28.6 The motor system]]

### Lower motor neurons
Lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord innervate a group of muscle bres termed a ‘motor unit’. Loss of lower motor neurons causes loss of contraction within this unit, resulting in weakness and reduced muscle tone. Subsequently, denervated muscle bres atrophy, causing muscle wasting, and depolarise spontaneously, causing ‘brillations’. Except in the tongue, these are usually perceptible only on electromyography (EMG; p. 1132). With the passage of time, neighbouring intact neurons sprout to provide re-innervation, but the neuromuscular junctions of the enlarged motor units are unstable and depolarise spontaneously, causing fasciculations (large enough to be visible). Fasciculations therefore imply chronic denervation with partial re-innervation.

### Upper motor neurons 
Upper motor neurons have both inhibitory and excitatory inuence on the function of lower motor neurons in the anterior horn. Lesions affecting the upper motor neuron result in increased tone, most evident in the strongest muscle groups (i.e. the extensors of the lower limbs and the exors of the upper limbs). The weakness of upper motor neuron lesions is conversely more pronounced in the opposing muscle groups. Loss of inhibition will also lead to brisk reexes and enhanced reex patterns of movement, such as exion withdrawal to noxious stimuli and spasms of extension. The increased tone is more apparent during rapid stretching (‘spastic catch’) but may quickly give way with sustained tension (the ‘clasp-knife’ phenomenon). More primitive reexes are also released, manifest as extensor plantar responses. Spasticity may not be present until some weeks after the onset of an upper motor neuron lesion.

## The extrapyramidal system
Circuits between the basal ganglia and the motor cortex constitute the extrapyramidal system, which controls muscle tone, body posture and the initiation of movement (see Fig. 28.6). Lesions of the extrapyramidal system produce an increase in tone that, unlike spasticity, is continuous throughout the range of movement at any speed of stretch (‘lead pipe’ rigidity). Involuntary movements are also a feature of extrapyramidal lesions, and tremor in combination with rigidity produces typical ‘cogwheel’ rigidity. Extrapyramidal lesions also cause slowed and clumsy movements (bradykinesia), which characteristically reduce in size with repetition, as well as postural instability, which can precipitate falls.

## The cerebellum
The cerebellum ne-tunes and coordinates movement initiated by the motor cortex, including articulation of speech. It also participates in the planning and learning of skilled movements through reciprocal connections with the thalamus and cortex. A lesion in a cerebellar hemisphere causes lack of coordination on the same side of the body. Cerebellar dysfunction impairs the smoothness of eye movements, causing nystagmus, and renders speech dysarthric. In the limbs, the initial movement is normal, but as the target is approached, the accuracy of the movement deteriorates, producing an ‘intention tremor’. The distances of targets are misjudged (dysmetria), resulting in ‘past-pointing’. The ability to produce rapid, accurate, regularly alternating movements is also impaired (dysdiadochokinesis). The central vermis of the cerebellum is concerned with the coordination of gait and posture. Disorders of this area therefore produce a characteristic ataxic gait (see below).

## Vision
The neurological organisation of visual pathways is shown in Figure 28.7. Fibres from ganglion cells in the retina pass to the optic disc and then backwards through the lamina cribrosa to the optic nerve. Nasal optic nerve bres (subserving the temporal visual eld) cross at the chiasm but temporal bres do not. Hence, bres in each optic tract and further posteriorly carry representation of contralateral visual space. From the lateral geniculate nucleus, lower bres pass through the temporal lobes on their way to the primary visual area in the occipital cortex, while the upper bres pass through the parietal lobe.
Normally, the eyes move conjugately (in the same direction at the same speed), though horizontal convergence allows fusion of images at different distances. The control of eye movements begins in the cerebral hemispheres, particularly within the frontal eye elds, and the pathway then descends to the brainstem with input from the visual cortex, superior colliculus and cerebellum. Horizontal and vertical gaze centres in the pons and mid-brain, respectively, coordinate output to the ocular motor nerve nuclei (3, 4 and 6), which are connected to each other by the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) (Fig. 28.8). The MLF is particularly important in coordinating horizontal movements of the eyes. The resulting signals to extraocular muscles are supplied by the oculomotor (3rd), trochlear (4th) and abducens (6th) cranial nerves. The pupillary size is determined by a combination of parasympathetic and sympathetic activity. Parasympathetic bres originate in the Edinger–Westphal subnucleus of the 3rd nerve, and pass with the 3rd nerve to synapse in the ciliary ganglion before supplying the constrictor pupillae of the iris. Sympathetic bres originate in the hypothalamus, pass down the brainstem and cervical spinal cord to emerge at T1, return up to the eye in association with the internal carotid artery, and supply the dilator pupillae.

### [[Davidson Neurology 6.webp|Fig. 28.8 Control of conjugate eye movements]]

## Speech
Much of the cerebral cortex is involved in the process of forming and interpreting communicating sounds, especially in the dominant hemisphere (see Box 28.2). Decoding of speech sounds (phonemes) is carried out in the upper part of the posterior temporal lobe. The attribution of meaning, as well as the formulation of the language required for the expression of ideas and concepts, occurs predominantly in the lower parts of the anterior parietal lobe (the angular and supramarginal gyri). The temporal speech comprehension region is called Wernicke's area (Fig. 28.9). Other parts of the temporal lobe contribute to verbal memory, where lexicons of meaningful words are ‘stored’. Parts of the non-dominant parietal lobe appear to contribute to non-verbal aspects of language in recognising meaningful intonation patterns (prosody). The frontal language area is in the posterior end of the dominant inferior frontal gyrus known as Broca's area. This receives input from the temporal and parietal lobes via the arcuate fasciculus. The motor commands generated in Broca's area pass to the cranial nerve nuclei in the pons and medulla, as well as to the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord. Nerve impulses to the lips, tongue, palate, pharynx, larynx and respiratory muscles result in the series of ordered sounds comprising speech. The cerebellum also plays an important role in coordinating speech, and lesions of the cerebellum lead to dysarthria, where the problem lies in motor articulation of speech.

### [[Davidson Neurology 7.webp|Fig. 28.9 Areas of the cerebral cortex involved in the generation of spoken language.]]

## The somatosensory system
The body surface can be described by dermatomes, each dermatome being an area of skin in which sensory nerves derive from a single spinal nerve root (Fig. 28.10). Sensory information ascends in two anatomically discrete systems (Fig. 28.11). Fibres from proprioceptive organs and those mediating specic sensation (including vibration) enter the spinal cord at the posterior horn and pass without synapsing into the ipsilateral posterior columns. In contrast, bres conveying pain and temperature sensory information (nociceptive neurons) synapse with second-order neurons that cross the midline in the spinal cord before ascending in the contralateral anterolateral spinothalamic tract to the brainstem. The second-order neurons of the dorsal column sensory system
cross the midline in the upper medulla to ascend through the brainstem. Here they lie just medial to the (already crossed) spinothalamic pathway. Brainstem lesions can therefore cause sensory loss affecting all modalities on the contralateral side of the body. Distribution of facial sensory loss due to brainstem lesions arises from the anatomy of the trigeminal bres within the brainstem. Fibres from the back of the face (near the ears) descend within the brainstem to the upper part of the spinal cord before synapsing, the second-order neurons crossing the midline and then ascending with the spinothalamic bres. Fibres conveying sensation from more anterior areas of the face descend a shorter distance in the brainstem. Thus, sensory loss in the face from low brainstem lesions is in a ‘balaclava helmet’ distribution, as the longer descending trigeminal bres are affected. Both dorsal column and spinothalamic tracts end in the thalamus, relaying from there to the parietal cortex.

### [[Davidson Neurology 8.webp|Fig. 28.10 The areas supplied by specific levels of the spinal cord.]]

### [[Davidson Neurology 9.webp|Fig. 28.11 The main somatic sensory pathways.]]

### Pain
Pain is a complex perception that is only partly related to activity in nociceptor neurons (Fig. 8.2). Higher up, chronic and severe pain interacts extensively with mood and can exacerbate or be exacerbated by mood disorder, including depression and anxiety. Modication of psychological and psychiatric sequelae is a vital part of pain management (see Ch. 8).

### Sphincter control 
The sympathetic supply to the bladder arises from roots T11–L2 to synapse in the inferior hypogastric plexus, while the parasympathetic supply leaves from S2–4. In addition, a somatic supply to the external (voluntary) sphincter arises from S2–4, travelling via the pudendal nerves. Storage of urine is maintained by inhibiting parasympathetic activity
and thus relaxing the detrusor muscle of the bladder wall. Continence is also helped by simultaneous sympathetic- and somatic-mediated tonic contraction of the urethral sphincters. Voiding in adults is usually carried out under conscious control, which triggers relaxation of tonic inhibition on the pontine micturition centre from higher centres, leading to relaxation of the pelvic oor muscles and external and internal urethral sphincters, along with parasympathetic-mediated detrusor contraction.

## Personality and mood
The physiology and pathology of mood disorders are discussed elsewhere (Ch. 31) but it is important to remember that any process affecting brain function may inuence mood and affect. Conversely, mood disorder may have a signicant effect on perception and function. It can be difcult to disentangle whether psychological and psychiatric changes are the cause or the effect of any neurological symptoms.

## Sleep
The function of sleep is unknown but it is required for health. Sleep is controlled by the reticular activating system in the upper brainstem and diencephalon. It is composed of different stages that can be visualised on electroencephalography (EEG). As drowsiness occurs, normal EEG background alpha rhythm disappears and activity becomes dominated by deepening slow-wave activity. As sleep deepens and dreaming begins, the limbs become accid, movements are ‘blocked’ and EEG signs of rapid eye movements (REM) are superimposed on the slow wave. REM sleep persists for a short spell before another slow-wave spell starts, the cycle repeating several times throughout the night. REM phases lengthen as sleep progresses. REM sleep seems to be the most important part of the sleep cycle for refreshing cognitive processes, and REM sleep deprivation causes tiredness, irritability and impaired judgement.

# Localising lesions in the central nervous system
After taking a history and examining the patient, the clinician should have an idea of the nature and site of any pathology (see Box 28.10). Given the intricate anatomy of the brainstem, this section will dwell on the possible localisation in more detail (see Fig. 28.5). Brainstem lesions typically present with symptoms due to cranial
nerve, cerebellar and upper motor neuron dysfunction and are most commonly caused by vascular disease. Since the anatomy of the brainstem is very precisely organised, it is usually possible to localise the site of a lesion on the basis of careful history and examination in order to determine exactly which tracts/nuclei are affected, usually invoking the fewest number of lesions. For example, in a patient presenting with sudden onset of upper motor
neuron features affecting the right face, arm and leg in association with a left 3rd nerve palsy, the lesion will be in the left cerebral peduncle in the brainstem and the pathology is likely to have been a discrete stroke, as the onset was sudden. Examples of brainstem lesions are listed in Box 28.3. The effects of individual cranial nerve decits are discussed elsewhere in this chapter in the sections on eye movements, and on facial weakness, sensory loss in brainstem lesions, dysphonia and dysarthria, and bulbar symptoms.

    - **Medulla (Lateral Medullary Syndrome)**: Ipsilateral 5th/9th/10th/11th nerve palsies, cerebellar signs, contralateral spinothalamic loss.

### **Spinal Cord**
- **Structure**: White matter (ascending/descending tracts) and grey matter (reflex centers).
- **Motor/Sensory Pathways**:
  - **Pyramidal Tract**: Descends from motor cortex, crosses in medulla, synapses with lower motor neurons (LMNs).
  - **Sensory Pathways**: Dorsal columns (proprioception/vibration) and spinothalamic tracts (pain/temperature).

### **Peripheral Nerves**
- **Sensory Nerves**:
  - Cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia.
  - Myelinated (fast, proprioception) vs. unmyelinated (slow, pain/temperature) axons.
- **Motor Nerves**:
  - LMNs in spinal anterior horns release acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions.
  - LMN loss → muscle atrophy, fasciculations; UMN lesions → spasticity, hyperreflexia.

### **Autonomic System**
- **Divisions**:
  - **Parasympathetic**: Innervates smooth muscle, glands (e.g., bladder control).
  - **Sympathetic**: Regulates cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic functions.
- **Control**: Brainstem, limbic system, hypothalamus, and frontal lobes modulate arousal and stress responses.

### **Motor System**
- **Hierarchy**:
  - **Pyramidal (Corticospinal) Tract**: Voluntary movement control.
  - **Extrapyramidal System**: Basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex circuits regulate tone/posture; lesions cause rigidity (lead-pipe/cogwheel) and bradykinesia.
  - **Cerebellum**: Coordinates skilled movements, speech articulation, and gait; lesions → intention tremor, dysmetria, ataxia.
- **Reflexes**: Spinal cord grey matter controls monosynaptic (stretch reflex) and polysynaptic (flexion/extension) responses.

### **Vision**
- **Pathways**:
  - Retinal ganglion cells → optic nerve → chiasm (nasal fibers cross) → optic tract → lateral geniculate nucleus → occipital cortex.
  - Eye movements coordinated by frontal eye fields, brainstem nuclei (3rd, 4th, 6th cranial nerves), and MLF (medial longitudinal fasciculus).
- **Pupillary Control**:
  - Parasympathetic (Edinger–Westphal nucleus via 3rd nerve) → constriction.
  - Sympathetic (T1 via internal carotid) → dilation.

### **Speech**
- **Cortical Areas**:
  - **Broca’s Area (Dominant Frontal Lobe)**: Motor speech production.
  - **Wernicke’s Area (Dominant Temporal Lobe)**: Language comprehension.
  - **Arcuate Fasciculus**: Connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas for language integration.
- **Cerebellar Role**: Dysarthria occurs with cerebellar damage.

### **Somatosensory System**
- **Dermatomes**: Skin areas innervated by specific spinal nerves.
- **Pathways**:
  - **Dorsal Columns**: Ascend ipsilaterally (proprioception/vibration).
  - **Spinothalamic Tracts**: Cross in spinal cord, ascend contralaterally (pain/temperature).
- **Facial Sensory Loss**: Balaclava distribution in brainstem lesions due to long-traveling trigeminal fibers.
- **Pain Perception**: Integrates sensory input with psychological factors (e.g., depression/anxiety).

### **Sphincter Control**
- **Bladder**:
  - Sympathetic (T11–L2): Inhibits detrusor muscle.
  - Parasympathetic (S2–S4): Contracts detrusor.
  - Somatic (S2–S4 via pudendal nerves): Controls external sphincter.
- **Voiding**: Requires pontine micturition center activation and coordinated relaxation/contraction.

### **Personality, Mood, and Sleep**
- **Mood**: Neurological disorders can alter mood, and vice versa (complex interplay).
- **Sleep**:
  - Regulated by brainstem reticular activating system.
  - **REM Sleep**: Critical for cognitive refreshment; deprivation causes irritability and impaired judgment.
  - **Stages**: Slow-wave (deep sleep) and REM cycles alternate throughout the night.

### **Localization of CNS Lesions**
- **Brainstem Lesions**: Prioritize cranial nerve, cerebellar, and UMN signs for precise localization (e.g., midbrain stroke → 3rd nerve palsy + contralateral hemiparesis).
- **Cortical vs. Subcortical**: Lesions in specific lobes or deeper structures (e.g., basal ganglia, thalamus) produce distinct deficits (e.g., aphasia, apraxia, sensory loss).

---

**Key Clinical Correlations**:
- **UMN Lesions**: Spasticity, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses.
- **LMN Lesions**: Muscle atrophy, fasciculations, flaccid weakness.
- **Cerebellar Dysfunction**: Intention tremor, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia.
- **Visual Field Defects**: Homonymous hemianopia (optic tract damage), bitemporal defects (chiasm lesion).
- **Sensory Loss**: Contralateral in spinothalamic lesions, ipsilateral in dorsal column lesions.

This summary integrates anatomical structures, physiological functions, and clinical manifestations, emphasizing localization principles and the interplay between neurological and psychological processes.

**Summary of Functional Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System**

The nervous system is a complex network of specialized cells and structures that coordinate sensory input, motor output, and higher cognitive functions. Here's a concise overview:

### **1. Cells of the Nervous System**
- **Neurons**: Primary functional units transmitting electrical and chemical signals.
- **Glial cells**: Support neurons and include:
  - **Astrocytes**: Maintain the blood-brain barrier and regulate the biochemical environment.
  - **Oligodendrocytes** (CNS) and **Schwann cells** (PNS): Produce myelin to insulate axons.
  - **Microglia**: Immune cells that combat infection and clear debris.
  - **Ependymal cells**: Line the ventricles and regulate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

### **2. Nerve Impulse Transmission**
- **Action potentials** are generated by electrochemical gradients and propagated along axons.
- **Synaptic transmission** involves neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine, dopamine) released into the synaptic cleft, influencing postsynaptic receptors.
- Neurotransmitters regulate acute responses (e.g., muscle contraction) and long-term processes (e.g., memory).

### **3. Functional Anatomy**
#### **Cerebral Hemispheres**
- Divided into four lobes with specialized functions:
  - **Frontal**: Executive function, motor control, speech (Broca’s area), and behavior.
  - **Parietal**: Sensory integration, spatial awareness, and language (dominant hemisphere).
  - **Temporal**: Auditory processing, memory (hippocampus), and emotion (amygdala).
  - **Occipital**: Visual processing.
- **Basal ganglia**, **thalamus**, and **hypothalamus** regulate movement, sensory relay, and homeostasis, respectively.

#### **Brainstem**
- Connects the cerebrum to the spinal cord.
- Houses cranial nerve nuclei (e.g., for eye movement, facial sensation) and the **reticular formation** (arousal, cardiorespiratory control).

#### **Spinal Cord**
- Relays sensory and motor signals between the brain and body.
- Contains reflex circuits (e.g., stretch reflexes).

#### **Peripheral Nervous System**
- **Sensory neurons**: Transmit stimuli from receptors to the CNS.
- **Motor neurons**: Innervate muscles via neuromuscular junctions.

#### **Autonomic System**
- **Sympathetic**: "Fight or flight" responses.
- **Parasympathetic**: "Rest and digest" functions.

### **4. Motor Systems**
- **Upper motor neurons** (UMN): Originate in the cortex; lesions cause spasticity and hyperreflexia.
- **Lower motor neurons** (LMN): Directly innervate muscles; lesions lead to weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations.
- **Extrapyramidal system** (basal ganglia): Controls posture and movement; dysfunction causes rigidity or tremors (e.g., Parkinson’s disease).
- **Cerebellum**: Coordinates movement and balance; lesions result in ataxia and dysarthria.

### **5. Sensory Systems**
- **Vision**: Optic pathways project from the retina to the occipital cortex; lesions cause field defects (e.g., hemianopia).
- **Speech**: Involves Wernicke’s (comprehension) and Broca’s (expression) areas.
- **Somatosensory pathways**: 
  - **Dorsal column**: Fine touch and proprioception.
  - **Spinothalamic tract**: Pain and temperature.
- **Pain**: Mediated by nociceptors and modulated by psychological factors.

### **6. Other Functions**
- **Mood and personality**: Influenced by limbic system and frontal lobe.
- **Sleep**: Regulated by the reticular activating system; REM sleep is critical for cognitive restoration.

### **7. Localizing Lesions**
- Brainstem lesions (e.g., stroke) often present with cranial nerve deficits, contralateral motor/sensory loss, or cerebellar signs (e.g., lateral medullary syndrome).
- Cortical lesions are identified by functional deficits (e.g., aphasia, hemineglect).

The provided text is a comprehensive overview of the functional anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. Here's a summary of the key points:

**Cells of the Nervous System**

* The nervous system consists of billions of specialized cells, including neurons and glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglial cells, and ependymal cells).
* Astrocytes form the structural framework for neurons and control their biochemical environment.
* Oligodendrocytes are responsible for the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath.
* Microglial cells play a role in fighting infection and removing damaged cells.

**Generation and Transmission of the Nervous Impulse**

* The central nervous system (CNS) generates outputs in response to external stimuli and internal conditions.
* Each neuron receives input from dendrites, which sum to produce output in the form of an action potential.
* Synaptic transmission involves the release of neurotransmitters to interact with structures on the target cell's surface.

**Functional Anatomy of the Nervous System**

* The cerebral hemispheres coordinate higher-level nervous functions, with different lobes specialized for different functions (e.g., frontal lobe for executive function, parietal lobe for sensory perception).
* The brainstem houses the nuclei and projections of most cranial nerves, as well as other important collections of neurons.
* The spinal cord is the route for communication between extracranial structures and the CNS.

**Motor System**

* The motor system consists of a hierarchy of controls that maintain body posture and muscle tone.
* The pyramidal tract transmits signals from the motor cortex to the spinal cord.
* The extrapyramidal system controls muscle tone, body posture, and the initiation of movement.

**Sensory Systems**

* The somatosensory system transmits information from the body surface to the brain.
* The visual pathway involves the transmission of information from the retina to the primary visual cortex.
* Pain is a complex perception that involves multiple pathways and interactions with mood and other factors.

**Other Functions**

* Speech involves the coordination of multiple brain areas, including Broca's area and Wernicke's area.
* Sphincter control involves the coordination of sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic nervous systems.
* Personality and mood are influenced by brain function and can be affected by neurological disorders.
* Sleep is controlled by the reticular activating system and involves different stages, including REM and non-REM sleep.

**Localising Lesions in the Central Nervous System**

* Brainstem lesions can be localized based on the combination of cranial nerve, cerebellar, and upper motor neuron dysfunction.
* The site of a lesion can be determined by careful history and examination, taking into account the anatomy of the brainstem and the tracts and nuclei involved.
