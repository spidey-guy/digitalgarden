Muscle disease, either hereditary or acquired, is rare. Most typically, it presents with a proximal symmetrical weakness. Diagnosis is dependent on recognition of clinical clues, such as cardiorespiratory involvement, evolution, family history, exposure to drugs, the presence of contractures, myotonia and other systemic features, and on investigation ndings, most importantly EMG and muscle biopsy. Hereditary syndromes include the muscular dystrophies, muscle channelopathies,
metabolic myopathies (including mitochondrial diseases) and congenital myopathies.

# Muscular dystrophies
These are inherited disorders with progressive muscle destruction and may be associated with cardiac and/or respiratory involvement and sometimes non-myopathic features (Box 28.90). Myotonic dystrophy is the most common, with a prevalence of about 12/100 000.

## Clinical features
The pattern of the clinical features is dened by the specic syndromes. Onset is often in childhood, although some patients, especially those with myotonic dystrophy, may present as adults. Wasting and weakness are usually symmetrical, without fasciculation or sensory loss, and tendon reexes are usually preserved until a late stage. Weakness is usually proximal, except in myotonic dystrophy type 1, when it is distal.
## Investigations 
The diagnosis can be conrmed by specic molecular genetic testing, supplemented with EMG and muscle biopsy if necessary. Creatine kinase is markedly elevated in the dystrophinopathies (Duchenne and Becker) but is normal or moderately elevated in the other dystrophies. Screening for an associated cardiac abnormality (cardiomyopathy or dysrhythmia) is important.
## Management 
There is no specic therapy for most of these conditions but physiotherapy and occupational therapy help patients cope with their disability. Glucocorticoids can be used in Duchenne muscular dystrophy but side-effects should be anticipated and avoided by dose modication. Treatment of associated cardiac failure or arrhythmia (with pacemaker insertion if necessary) may be required; similarly, management of respiratory complications (including nocturnal hypoventilation) can improve quality of life. Improvements in non-invasive ventilation have led to signicant improvements in survival for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Genetic counselling is important.

# Inherited metabolic myopathies
There are a large number of rare inherited disorders that interfere with the biochemical pathways that maintain the energy supply (adenosine triphosphate, ATP) to muscles. These are mostly recessively inherited deciencies in the enzymes necessary for glycogen or fatty acid (β-oxidation) metabolism (Box 28.91). They typically present with muscle weakness and pain.

## Mitochondrial disorders
Mitochondrial diseases are discussed on page 47. Mitochondria are present in all tissues and dysfunction causes widespread effects on vision (optic atrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, cataracts), hearing (sensorineural deafness) and the endocrine, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and renal systems. Any combination of these should raise the suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder, especially if there is evidence of maternal transmission. Mitochondrial dysfunction can be caused by alterations in either mitochondrial DNA or genes encoding for oxidative processes. Genetic abnormalities or mutations in mitochondrial DNA may affect single individuals and single tissues (most commonly muscle). Thus, patients with exercise intolerance, myalgia and sometimes recurrent myoglobinuria may have isolated pathogenic mutations in genes encoding for oxidation pathways. Inherited disorders of the oxidative pathways of the respiratory chain in mitochondria cause a group of disorders, either restricted to the muscle or associated with non-myopathic features (Box 28.92). Many of these mitochondrial disorders are inherited via the mitochondrial genome, down the maternal line. Diagnosis is based on clinical appearances, supported by muscle biopsy appearance (usually with ‘ragged red’ and/ or cytochrome oxidase-negative bres), and specic mutations either on blood or, more reliably, muscle testing. Mutations may be due either to point mutations or to deletions of mitochondrial DNA. A disorder called Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is characterised by acute or subacute loss of vision, most frequently in males, due to bilateral optic atrophy. Three point mutations account for more than 90% of LHON cases.

## Channelopathies
Inherited abnormalities of the sodium, calcium and chloride ion channels in striated muscle produce various syndromes of familial periodic paralysis, myotonia and malignant hyperthermia, which may be recognised by their clinical characteristics and potassium abnormalities (Box 28.93). Genetic testing is available.

**Summary of Muscle Diseases**  

### **Hereditary Muscle Diseases**  
1. **Muscular Dystrophies**  
   - **Inherited progressive disorders** with muscle weakness, often involving cardiac/respiratory systems.  
   - **Key Types**:  
     - **Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1/DM2)**: Most common; distal weakness (DM1) or proximal (DM2), myotonia, cardiac issues, and multisystem involvement.  
     - **Duchenne/Becker**: X-linked; proximal weakness, cardiomyopathy (Duchenne more severe).  
     - **Limb-Girdle**: Variable genetic causes; limb-girdle weakness, possible cardiac/respiratory involvement.  
     - **Facioscapulohumeral (FSH)**: Autosomal dominant; facial/shoulder weakness, deafness.  
     - **Oculopharyngeal**: Ptosis, dysphagia, late onset.  
     - **Emery–Dreifuss**: Early contractures, cardiac arrhythmias.  
   - **Diagnosis**: Genetic testing, EMG, muscle biopsy; elevated CK in dystrophinopathies.  
   - **Management**: Physiotherapy, glucocorticoids (Duchenne), cardiac/respiratory support.  

2. **Metabolic Myopathies**  
   - **Enzyme deficiencies** in glycogen/lipid metabolism causing exercise-induced pain/weakness.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - **McArdle Disease**: Glycogen breakdown defect; "second wind" phenomenon, myoglobinuria.  
     - **Pompe Disease**: Acid maltase deficiency; infantile (fatal), adult (proximal myopathy).  
     - **CPT Deficiency**: Exercise-induced myalgia/myoglobinuria; normal CK between episodes.  
   - **Diagnosis**: Enzyme assays, muscle biopsy, genetic testing.  

3. **Mitochondrial Disorders**  
   - **Maternally inherited**; multisystem involvement (vision/hearing loss, diabetes, cardiomyopathy).  
   - **Key Syndromes**:  
     - **MELAS**: Stroke-like episodes, migraines, lactic acidosis.  
     - **MERRF**: Myoclonic epilepsy, ataxia, ragged red fibers on biopsy.  
     - **CPEO/Kearns–Sayre**: Ophthalmoplegia, heart block, retinopathy.  
   - **Diagnosis**: Muscle biopsy (ragged red fibers), mtDNA testing.  

4. **Channelopathies**  
   - **Ion channel defects** causing episodic weakness/myotonia.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - **Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis**: SCN4A mutations; cold/potassium-induced weakness.  
     - **Myotonia Congenita**: CLCN1 mutations; stiffness without weakness (Thomsen) or severe myotonia (Becker).  
     - **Malignant Hyperthermia**: RYR1/CACNA1S mutations; anesthesia-triggered hyperpyrexia.  
   - **Diagnosis**: Genetic testing, EMG, potassium levels.

### **Acquired Myopathies**  
1. **Inflammatory Myopathies** (e.g., polymyositis, dermatomyositis).  
2. **Metabolic/Endocrine**: Hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, diabetes.  
3. **Drug/Toxin-Induced**: Statins, corticosteroids, alcohol.  
4. **Critical Illness Myopathy**: ICU-associated weakness.  

---

### **Diagnosis & Management**  
- **Key Investigations**: Creatine kinase (elevated in dystrophinopathies), EMG, muscle biopsy, genetic testing.  
- **Management**:  
  - **Supportive**: Physiotherapy, mobility aids.  
  - **Specific**: Glucocorticoids (Duchenne), non-invasive ventilation (respiratory failure), pacemakers (cardiac arrhythmias).  
  - **Avoid Triggers**: Potassium-rich diets (hyperkalemic paralysis), certain anesthetics (malignant hyperthermia).  
- **Genetic Counseling**: Essential for hereditary forms.  

**Key Takeaway**: Muscle diseases are diverse, requiring detailed clinical evaluation, family history, and targeted investigations for accurate diagnosis and management.

Here's a structured summary of the "Disease of Muscle" note:

### **1. Muscle Disease Overview**
- **Types**: Hereditary or acquired (rare)
- **Presentation**: Proximal symmetric weakness
- **Diagnosis**: Clinical evaluation (cardiorespiratory involvement, family history, drug exposure, myotonia, etc.) + investigations (EMG, muscle biopsy)
- **Hereditary Categories**:
  - Muscular dystrophies
  - Metabolic myopathies (mitochondrial disorders)
  - Channelopathies
  - Congenital myopathies

### **2. Muscular Dystrophies**
- **Key Features**: Progressive muscle destruction, often with cardiac/respiratory involvement.
- **Types**:
  - **Myotonic (DM1/DM2)**: Most common; affects face, distal limbs; myotonia, cognitive/endocrine issues.
  - **Duchenne/Becker**: X-linked; dystrophin mutations; Duchenne is severe (cardiorespiratory failure), Becker is milder.
  - **Limb-girdle**: Variable subtypes; limb weakness.
  - **Facioscapulohumeral (FSH)**: Face/shoulder weakness; may involve hearing.
  - **Oculopharyngeal**: Ptosis, dysphagia.
  - **Emery-Dreifuss**: Early contractures; cardiac complications.
- **Management**: Supportive (PT/OT, cardiac/respiratory monitoring, glucocorticoids for Duchenne).

### **3. Inherited Metabolic Myopathies**
- **Disorders of energy metabolism (glycogen/fatty acid pathways)**.
  - **Glycogen storage (e.g., McArdle’s)**: Exercise-induced pain/myoglobinuria.
  - **Pompe disease**: Infantile (fatal) or adult-onset (progressive weakness).
  - **Mitochondrial disorders**: Multisystem (e.g., MELAS, MERRF, Kearns-Sayre).
